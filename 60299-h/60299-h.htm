<small>A NEW BOY ARRIVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“How far is it to Oak Park School,
please?”</p>

<p>The policeman on duty at the North Woodfield
station turned from watching the train
disappear westward along the track and gave
his attention to the speaker. What he saw
was a rather thin youth of fourteen with deeply
tanned face from which a pair of gray eyes
looked somewhat anxiously upward. The boy
had removed his hat, a dilapidated straw
adorned with a faded blue band, not out of
deference to the majesty of the law but because
the September afternoon was decidedly
hot, leaving to view a head of pale brown
hair, rumpled and damp, which had evidently
been trimmed both recently and poorly. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wore a suit of gray flannel, a white shirt, with
a stiff and creaky bosom, a narrow red four-in-hand
tie and tan shoes. In spite of the fact
that his attire was all of the most inexpensive
sort he was quite palpably “dressed up” and
extremely uncomfortable. He had set down
his bag, a small and very shiny contrivance of
imitation alligator skin, in order to run a new
and scratchy handkerchief around inside his
collar.</p>

<p>“What was it you asked?” inquired the
officer.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Oak Park School, sir?
And which way do I have to go, please?”</p>

<p>The officer had started a good many boys on
their initial journey to the school and had acquired
a method of procedure.</p>

<p>“Pick up your bag and I’ll show you, my
boy. Right through here.” He conducted his
charge across the waiting-room and out the
further door where, along the asphalt walk,
carriage drivers were clamoring for fares.</p>

<p>“The school’s about a half a mile up that
way. Any of these drivers will take you there.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll charge me, won’t they?” asked
the boy.</p>

<p>“Sure! They ain’t doing it for their health.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
It’s only a quarter, though. You can stand
that, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather walk if you’ll tell me how to
go.”</p>

<p>The officer turned for another survey of the
boy before he replied. He had seen a number
of Oak Park School boys, but this was the first
one who had ever in his experience saved carriage
fare. “Don’t quite look like he belonged
at that school,” he said to himself. Then,</p>

<p>“’D rather walk, eh? Well, you cross the
common here and take that street over by the
hardware store. See? Keep right on that
until you get to the school. You can’t miss it.
Going to the Hall, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; West House.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a bit farther, but you’d better
go up to the school and then cross over through
the park. You might go another way, but it’s
longer and a good deal hotter walking, I guess.
If I was you, though, I’d take a carriage.
There’s a load of the boys going up now. Better
go with ’em.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’d rather walk, thanks. It ain’t
very far.” He put on his hat and returned his
handkerchief to his pocket. “Much obliged,
sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you’re welcome. Better take it easy;
it’s a hot day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I will.”</p>

<p>The officer watched him cross the road, enter
the common and strike off toward the other
side of the Square. He smiled and then he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Wonder how he came here,” he muttered.
“I guess he’s in for a lot of guying when the
rest of ’em catch sight of him. Well, he’ll live
through it.”</p>

<p>The boy reached the farther side of the common
and started across the street in front of
the hardware store. At that moment a three-seated
surrey containing the driver, four boys
and numerous suit-cases came along and the
boy on foot had to retreat hurriedly to keep
from being run down.</p>

<p>“Look out there, farmer! Most got you
that time!”</p>

<p>“Look where you’re going, kid!”</p>

<p>He had a brief glimpse of laughing, mocking
faces and then the surrey, drawn by a pair of
sleek bays, dashed around the corner out of
sight. He started again across the street, this
time looking cautiously to left and right. But
the course was clear now. Across from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hardware store was a druggist’s and huge
placards told enticingly of “Ice Cold Soda”
and “College Ices.” One hand went tentatively
into his trousers pocket as the hiss of
the soda fountain came to him. But it came
out again empty and he turned down the street
toward the school. “Elm Street” said the
sign on the corner, but the elms were not in
sight. Beyond an occasional maple, too small
to throw shade, the street was treeless and the
hot sunlight beat remorselessly down on either
sidewalk.</p>

<p>There had been a fountain in the common
and he wished now that he had stopped and
had a drink. For a block or two small stores
lined the way and he considered entering one
of them and asking for water. But they were
all shabby and untidy and by the time he had
made up his mind to ask he had left them behind,
and houses, no more attractive than the
stores, had taken their place. He took the
policeman’s advice and walked slowly, for in
spite of the fact that it wanted but a week to
the first of October the day was as hot as an
August one and the stiff shirt and the vest,
both articles of attire with which he was somewhat
unfamiliar, increased his discomfort. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hoped that the policeman hadn’t underestimated
the distance to the school. The bag,
while it wasn’t very heavy, didn’t make progress
any easier. And that awful collar was
squeezing his neck like a vise!</p>

<p>He had started from home after an early
dinner feeling decidedly excited and elated,
but the elation was dwindling fast with every
step, and the excitement had changed to something
that savored both of dismay and homesickness.
When, away last Spring, it had been
decided in family council that he was to go to
boarding school and prepare for college the
prospect had filled him with delight. Now he
wished himself back in West Bayport. He
already missed the sight and smell of the ocean
and the wharves and the shipping. It seemed
unpleasantly shut in here, and the air was
dead and held no tang, and the street was deep
in yellowish-gray dust and even the hills in the
distance looked hot and wilted under their
purple haze. On the whole, he was sorely
tempted to retrace his steps and take the next
train homeward, abandoning Oak Park and
college and all they stood for.</p>

<p>But of course he didn’t. If he had his name
wouldn’t have been John William Boland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Moreover, there wouldn’t have been any story!
No, he kept right along the hot road which
presently bore to the left and became gradually
shady with spreading elms. The shabby dwellings
died away from either side and open lots
and then broad fields succeeded them. Once
he rested for a good five minutes perched on
a stone wall in the grateful shade of a big elm,
and while he sat there, hat off, rumpled hair
exposed to a little listless breeze, shiny bag
at his feet, two carriages filled to the brim with
boys, arrivals on a later train, rattled merrily
and noisily by him, and he was uncomfortably
conscious of the curious looks and the muttered
comments proceeding from them.</p>

<p>He didn’t think he was going to like Oak
Park School and regretted that he hadn’t held
out for one of the institutions which his own
choice had fallen upon when the little white
cottage at West Bayport had been inundated
for weeks with school catalogues. He recalled
one in particular, Seaview Academy, an
imposing brick building fronting the ocean,
backed with a jolly looking forest and adorned
on all sides by winding paths sprinkled with
boys and strange-shaped flower beds blooming
tropically. But Seaview had been quite out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the question with its seven hundred dollar
tuition fee, and, like several others which had
caught his fancy, had been set aside as something
beautiful but impossible.</p>

<p>There had been a time when the Bolands
were prosperous. That was before Captain
Jonathan Boland, master and half-owner of
the fishing schooner <i>Patriot</i>, had been lost with
all hands on the Grand Banks and Mrs. Boland
and John and his sister Nan had been left
with only the small house overlooking the harbor
and a very little money. The disaster had
occurred when John was ten and his sister a
year younger, and since that time the family
had often had hard work to make ends meet.
John and Nan attended public school, and in
the summer the former found what work he
could. The wages weren’t large, but they
helped. One summer he had obtained a place
in a sail-loft, and another year had nailed
“flats” into boxes at the fish house. But the
best summer of all had been the one just past,
when he had served as one of the crew of three
on the little auxiliary sloop <i>Emma Boyd</i>, which
sailed or chugged about the harbor selling
water to the fishing boats.</p>

<p>It was the death of Uncle Thomas that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
altered the boy’s prospects. Uncle Thomas
had been his mother’s brother, a mysterious,
seldom seen old man who had lived in Maine
and who, when he decided to die at the respectable
age of seventy-odd, had left a legacy
of a thousand dollars to his sister. News of it
had reached Mrs. Boland in the late winter
and not for an instant had there been any
doubt in her mind as to the investment of the
money. It was to go toward her boy’s education.
It wouldn’t take him through college,
of course, but, with care, it might prepare him
for it; and once old enough to find employment
at a man’s wages, he could, she was certain,
with the Lord’s help, manage the rest
himself. Mrs. Boland had always been a firm
believer in trusting to the Lord, and so far she
had never been disappointed.</p>

<p>John was to study hard and prepare himself
for college in three years. Neither himself nor
his mother nor Sister Nan doubted his ability
to do this; Nan least of all, perhaps, for to
her John was something just short of super-human.
Had the legacy been larger John
could have afforded another year at school,
but with a thousand dollars only to draw on,
and tuition at good schools seldom being less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
than three hundred a year, you can see that
three years was bound to be his limit. So the
legacy was placed untouched in the savings
bank and the entire family began a systematic
study of preparatory schools. In the end Oak
Park had won the privilege of enrolling John
William Boland among its pupils. The tuition
at Oak Park was three hundred dollars a year,
a price made possible by endowments from
former students. It was only a dollar and
twenty cents from West Bayport—you see
the Bolands reckoned distance in terms of carfares!—and
it possessed in addition most of
the advantages offered by larger and more
expensive schools. I think, though, that it was
the phrase in the advertisement alluding to
moral character that decided Mrs. Boland.
John remembered every word of that advertisement
yet; it had been read a dozen times
while awaiting the school catalogue.</p>

<p>“Oak Park School, North Woodfield, Mass.
Preparatory School for Boys. Estab. 1876.
Ideal equipment for health and study. Twenty-four
acres of elevated ground one hour from
Boston. Special attention given to boys of
fifteen and under. Enrollment limited to sixty
and only boys of high moral character accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
For further information address Dr. Horace
Mitchell Webster, Principal.”</p>

<p>John’s application had been forwarded in
June and a month later he had learned that
it had been accepted. From that moment he
had looked forward to this day. And now—why,
now he was dragging unwilling feet along
the road and heartily wishing himself back at
home! It was extremely unreasonable of him,
he knew, but somehow he just couldn’t help it.
It was not only unreasonable, it was ungrateful
besides. And while he was telling himself
so, with a terrific frown on his brown forehead,
the school suddenly appeared before him.</p>

<p>A neat stone wall, flat-topped and half-hidden
with ivy, began beside him and went on
to an ornamental iron gateway. Beyond the
wall was a broad expanse of velvety green turf
divided by drives and walks which led to the
four buildings in sight. The nearest of these
was a low two-story building of buff colored
brick and limestone trimming. John guessed
it to be the gymnasium, and he was right. It
was full of windows, most of which were open,
and the red slate roof looked very hot in the
sunlight. Near the gymnasium and further
from John was a handsome building of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stories, the lower of weathered shingles and
the upper two of creamy-hued plaster between
beams. There were two entrances, a square
porch before each, and on the porches and
steps were many boys. Still further away was
an old building of red brick, making no
pretence of architectural attractiveness and
draped in ivy. This was the recitation hall
doubtless. And quite a distance beyond the
three foremost buildings a fourth peered
around the corner of the center one. It too
was of shingle and stucco and beams, but it
was quite small. Beyond the school grounds
there was a fringe of trees, and back of that
the country rose and fell in meadows and
wooded hillsides.</p>

<p>The policeman had said that West House
was farther than the school itself and John
hesitated at the gate. Then his gaze crossed
the road and there was another gate, a rustic
one, with the sign “West House” above it.
So he turned his back on the school buildings
and went through the smaller gate and followed
a neat gravelled path that dipped down
to a wooden bridge. Above the bridge was an
oval pond half an acre in extent. Under and
below it a little brook ran, fern-fringed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
murmurous, to disappear in a patch of willows
and alders beyond. This was the park from
which the school took its name. The path led
upward again and wound westward through a
grove of oaks. Here and there shrubs and
plants, their leaves drooping and wilted, lined
the path. With the exception of the Public
Gardens in Boston, John had never seen anything
as beautiful as that far-reaching expanse
of turfed ground with the great wide-spreading
oak trees throwing their pools of dark green
shadow on the grass. There seemed to be no
limits to the park, for as far as he could see
his vision was shut in by leaf and branch and
trunk. Once he thought he spied the top of
a red chimney through the greenery, but he
wasn’t certain of that. He was certain, however,
that Oak Park School exceeded his expectations
as far as attractiveness went, and
he found so much pleasure in following the path
and viewing the new vistas of sun and shade
that opened up before him at every turn that
he quite forgot his former despondency and
was so absorbed that when, quite unexpectedly,
the trees stopped and a white cottage with
green blinds appeared before him he was quite
astounded.</p>

<p class="cap">“Dutch, you’re fatter than ever,” declared
The Fungus, digging his fingers
affectionately if painfully into the other’s neck
as he joined the group on the steps of West
House and lowered himself to a seat between
Dutch and Spud Halladay. Otto Zoller turned
upon him with indignation faintly visible on
his round, good-natured face.</p>

<p>“I’m not; I’m three pounds lighter than
last Spring.”</p>

<p>“Dutch is training down for quarter,” said
Fred Sanderson gravely. “How much do you
weigh now, Dutch?”</p>

<p>“Hundred and thirty-one and a half.”</p>

<p>“Dutch!”</p>

<p>“Honest, Sandy!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get that half-pound off
you,” said Spud. “Fat is fatal.”</p>

<p>“That’s cheek,” said Hooper Ross, a tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
youth of fifteen with amazingly black eyes and
hair. “You look like a little fat cherub yourself,
Spud.”</p>

<p>“Little fat rascal!” grunted The Fungus,
whose real name as entered in the school catalogue
was Fergus Worthington White. The
title of The Fungus suited him very well, for
he had the lightest of tow-colored hair and eyes
of a pale, washed-out blue. Spud aimed a kick
at his insulter, but it fell short and the effort
landed him on the next step below with a thud
that the other four boys found amusing.</p>

<p>“Where’s the new kid?” asked Sandy with
lowered voice.</p>

<p>The Fungus grinned.</p>

<p>“Up there,” he said, jerking his head
vaguely toward the second floor of the cottage.
“Unpacking. You ought to see the rafts of
stuff he’s brought; silver brushes and a patent
necktie holder that goes on the wall and trousers
stretcher—”</p>

<p>“Trousers stretcher! He’s wearing knickers,”
said Spud.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he told me he had some long
trousers in his trunk. Says he didn’t know
which was proper here. He’s a funny little
kid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Dutch.</p>

<p>“Parker, Claire Parker.”</p>

<p>“Claire? That’s a girl’s name, ain’t it?”
demanded Hoop.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He says it’s his. He looks
like a girl, too, with those nice little pink cheeks
of his. He will be a valuable addition to the
House Eleven, I don’t think!”</p>

<p>“I hope the other chap will be an improvement,”
said Sandy. “About time for him to
show up, seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Bet you he’s the fellow we saw sitting on
the wall,” said The Fungus. “Hope so, anyway.
Ned’s been rubbing it into me about the
youngster. I’d laugh myself to death if that
was the chap.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” scoffed Spud. “Why, he was
a regular farmer! Besides, he wouldn’t be
walking up.”</p>

<p>“He might. Why doesn’t Ned come down?”
The Fungus pulled himself up, descended the
steps and lolled out to the center of the half-moon-shaped
lawn that lay between the circling
drive and the fence. “O you Ned!”
he called, looking toward an upper window.</p>

<p>“Hello! What?” answered a voice.</p>

<p>“Come on down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“In a minute. I’m changing sides.”</p>

<p>The Fungus grinned as he strolled back to
the group on the steps. “Ned’s changing his
things over to the other side of the room,” he
explained. “That gives him the bay window.”</p>

<p>“Hope the new fellow can play football,”
mused Sandy. “We need some more talent
this year, now that Means and Carter have
gone. The Hall’s going to have a bully team.”</p>

<p>“How long since we won a game?” asked
Dutch.</p>

<p>“Three years,” answered Spud.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it? You weren’t
here,” said Sandy. Sanderson was sixteen
and, being the oldest boy in West House, was
House Leader and thereby privileged to administer
rebuke. Spud grinned.</p>

<p>“Neither were you, Sandy,” he replied
amiably.</p>

<p>“Didn’t say I was. And I don’t talk as
though I knew it all, Spud.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time we won again,” said Dutch,
breaking in on what threatened to develop into
one of the periodical disputes between the two.</p>

<p>“Sounds all right,” said The Fungus, “but
how you going to do it? It isn’t fair, anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The Hall’s got thirty-eight fellows to pick
from and the Houses only have twenty-two.
Besides, we get more than our share of Second
Juniors nowadays. Here’s this fellow Parker,
and I heard that East House is getting two of
them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe that,” said Dutch. “Brad
Miller told me they were only getting three
new boys altogether.”</p>

<p>“Three! They’re getting seven!” said
Sandy. “And we’re getting two and Hall’s
getting six. There are fifteen new boys this
Fall. Jim told me.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Hall’s lost Morgan and Chase
and Purdy this year,” exulted Hoop, “and
that’ll leave them hipped.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Grow’s just as good a tackle as
Morgan was,” declared Spud. “Only they
wouldn’t give him a fair show last year.
And—”</p>

<p>“Where’s my new fidus?” interrupted Ned
Brent, appearing through the doorway with
his hands thrust into the pockets of a pair of
voluminous homespun trousers and viewing
the group severely. “I want to see what I
draw.”</p>

<p>“Hope you draw something awful,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
The Fungus maliciously. “Hope he has red
hair and a mole on his nose and snores like
sixty and—and—”</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Sandy, sotto voce.
“See who’s here!”</p>

<p>Around the corner of the house, from the
direction of the park, appeared a fairly tall and
slender youth of fourteen from whose sun-browned
face a pair of gray eyes looked curiously
and embarrassedly at the group. He
swung a shiny imitation leather satchel as he
advanced along the path.</p>

<p>“Pipe the tie,” whispered Spud in Hoop’s
ear.</p>

<p>“<em>And</em> the trousers,” returned Hoop with a
grin. The Fungus watched the newcomer’s approach
with a broad smile of unholy joy. At
the foot of the steps the youth stopped.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p023">“Is this West House?” he asked</a>, his eyes
travelling from one face to another. There
followed intense silence. Sandy, as House
Leader, had the right to the first word and
Sandy was taking his time. Meanwhile six
pairs of eyes were fixed critically on the new
boy, ranging from the cheap yellow shoes, very
dusty from the journey, over the misfit trousers
and the jacket whose sleeves were too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
long, lingering on the vivid red tie, loose and
stringy from much wear, and lighting at last
on the battered straw hat with its very blue
ribbon. And the new boy, painfully aware of
the scrutiny, shifted from one foot to the other
and grew red under his dark tan. At last
Sandy spoke.</p>

<p>“This,” he drawled, “is Occidental Mansion.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the boy. “Then where—”
But he understood the next moment and smiled
a little.</p>

<p>“Then I cal’late this is where I belong,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You—<em>what</em>?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“I cal’late—”</p>

<p>“He’s a lightning calculator,” explained
Spud helpfully. “I saw one once at a circus.”</p>

<p>Sandy’s eyes rested frowningly on the bag.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” he said, “that we want to
buy anything today.”</p>

<p>“What have you got?” asked Hoop.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘huh’; say ‘What, sir?’” directed
Sandy severely.</p>

<p>“What, sir?”</p>

<p>“I say what have you got,” repeated Hoop.</p>

<p>“Got?” asked the other confusedly.</p>

<p>“Sure! What are you selling; what’s in
the grip there?”</p>

<p>“I’m not selling anything. I’ve got clothes
in here.”</p>

<p>“Are they like what you’re wearing?”
asked Spud innocently.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Spud,” growled Ned Brent.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“John Boland,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked The Fungus.</p>

<p>“West Bayport.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen.”</p>

<p>“What class?”</p>

<p>“Huh? I mean what, sir?”</p>

<p>“What class are you going into, Mr. Boland?”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’m going into the First Junior.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be nice for the First Junior, won’t
it?” laughed Dutch.</p>

<p>“Do you snore?” demanded The Fungus.</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>“You mean you cal’late not. Can you play
football?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’d like to try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fungus viewed him pityingly and
turned to Sandy.</p>

<p>“He’d like to try, Sandy.” Sandy shook
his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Where have I heard that before?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Well, Boland, you room with me, I guess,”
said Ned. “Come on in and I’ll call Marm.”</p>

<p>John looked gratefully up at his roommate
and edged his way between the others. Half
way up the steps Hoop stuck a foot out and
John completed his ascent hurriedly and ungracefully.
At the top he turned with flashing
eyes and clenched hand.</p>

<p>“Did you do that on purpose?” he demanded
of Hoop.</p>

<p>“Do what?” inquired Hoop surprisedly.</p>

<p>“Trip me up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I trip you up, Mr. Boland?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, and you know it. You did
it on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Well, supposing I did? Then what, you
fresh kid?”</p>

<p>John gazed at him wrathfully, and then his
eyes went over the other grinning faces and
fell. He swallowed hard once and then turned
toward the door. Hoop laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, hold on, kid! What if I did trip you
up?” he asked.</p>

<p>John turned at the door and looked back at
him.</p>

<p>“Nothing—now,” he said quietly, as he
entered the house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>A VISIT TO THE INQUISITORY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Mrs. Linn, the matron of West House,
was a short, ample, motherly woman of
some fifty years who had in some miraculous
manner preserved both her complexion and her
hair. Her cheeks bloomed like roses and her
tresses, which she wore wound high at the back
of her head in large braids, were hued like the
raven’s wing. She had been born in England,
had married an Englishman and had come to
this country soon after her wedding. Under
the stress of excitement she still lost an occasional
H. What had become of Mr. Linn was
a matter of conjecture amongst the boys, for
while the matron in her infrequent allusions to
him assumed the sorrowfully resigned air of
a widow, yet his fate was never explained.
Mrs. Linn had ruled over West House for
nearly fifteen years. She was not a disciplinarian;
in the face of revolt she was helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and tearful; and yet she got along very well.
You see, there wasn’t much fun in being bad
when you knew all the time that Mrs. Linn
was sitting in her room downstairs, rocking
back and forth in her patent rocker, and shedding
silent tears. Chivalry protested. At such
times West House sighed for a house master
of its own sex whom it could bait to its heart’s
content.</p>

<p>The fellows liked Mrs. Linn and called her
Marm—and poked good-natured fun at her
amongst themselves. Conversation was her
one weakness. She loved to talk. The boy
who listened patiently to her discourse won
her heart, a fact well known and taken frequent
advantage of. When a special privilege was
wanted West House to a man descended to the
matron’s room and sat around in respectful
and apparently interested attention while she
ran on and on. Then, at departure, Sandy
or Dutch, both prime favorites, proffered
their request in quite the most casual manner
in the world and it was almost invariably
granted.</p>

<p>The arrival of a new boy presented an opportunity
for discourse that Mrs. Linn always
made the most of and it was a good ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before Ned Brent closed the door behind her
with a sigh of relief. John, who had accorded
her polite attention every minute, thereby at
once gaining a foothold in her affections, now
turned to view his surroundings with frank interest.</p>

<p>West House accommodated eight boys, two
in each of the four rooms of the second floor.
Below were Mrs. Linn’s room and the kitchen
on one side and the parlor and dining room
on the other. Somewhere at the top of the
house dwelt Hulda, the maid, who combined
the duties of cook, waitress, chambermaid and
second-girl. The room in which John found
himself was officially known as Number 1, but
in house parlance was called the Den. In the
same way, Number 2, across the hall, was the
Ice Chest, so called because it was at the northwest
corner of the house and in winter attained
a temperature that would have made an arctic
explorer feel right at home. Back of the Ice
Chest was the Smellery. The Smellery was
over the kitchen and Dutch Zoller and Hoop
Ross, who dwelt therein, pretended to be able
to tell an hour beforehand what was to be
served at the next meal. The Sun Parlor, habitation
of The Fungus and his new roommate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was so named because it had the sun almost
all day. On the lower floor, Mrs. Linn’s room
was called the Throne Room, the kitchen was
the Hashery, the dining-room the Gobblery
and the parlor the Tomb. They were partial
to nicknames at Oak Park.</p>

<p>The Den, because it was at once on the front
of the house and had the benefit of the sun as
well, was accorded the distinction of being the
most desirable room. Like the others, it was
good-sized, very nearly square and well furnished.
On the side was a deep bay with a
seat all the way around it under the three
broad windows. On the front were two other
windows overlooking the lawn and the road
and the slope of the wooded hill beyond. There
were two beds, two bureaus, two shallow closets,
two easy chairs, a washstand and a study
table with a straight-backed chair at each side
of it. On Ned’s side of the room the walls
were lavishly hung with pictures. Straw matting
covered the floor and three small rugs
were disposed in front of bureaus and washstand.</p>

<p>“This is my side of the room,” announced
Ned, seating himself in his own particular easy
chair, “and that’s yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>John’s gaze came back from a survey of the
room and he nodded.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Why do they put all the pictures
over there?”</p>

<p>“Those are mine,” explained Ned. “You
can hang yours on your own side.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said John. “But, you see, I haven’t
got any.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring anything to fix up
with?” asked Ned in disgust. John shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No, I—didn’t know I should.” Then he
added: “Besides, I haven’t any, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can buy some in the town. Are
they bringing your trunk up?”</p>

<p>“It’s coming by express. I suppose it won’t
get here before tomorrow. It was cheaper to
send it that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Ned. He observed his new
roommate curiously.</p>

<p>“You said your name was Boland, didn’t
you? Well, mine’s Brent. Hope we’ll get on
all right. Now you’d better fix up a bit and
I’ll take you over to see Horace. You’re
supposed to report to him as soon as you
come.”</p>

<p>“Horace?” repeated John wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, the principal. His name’s Horace,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I thought—” began John.</p>

<p>“He will ask you a lot of questions and tell
you to be good, you know,” continued Ned with
a grin. “Don’t be saucy to him, Boland.”</p>

<p>“I don’t cal’late to,” replied John, reflecting
the grin. “I’ll wash up and brush
my hair. It was pretty hot walking up
here.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you take a chariot? Weren’t
there any?”</p>

<p>“You mean a carriage? Thought I’d rather
save my quarter.”</p>

<p>“You must be an economical duffer,” said
Ned with a frown. “I wouldn’t do too much
of that sort of thing or fellows will think
you’re a tight-wad. And, say, <a href="#i_p035">got any other
togs in that gripsack of yours?</a>”</p>

<p>“Togs? You mean clothes?”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“Only some collars and cuffs and a handkerchief
and some socks and—”</p>

<p>“Another suit?”</p>

<p>“No; why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” replied Ned evasively.
“Only Horace likes the fellows to dress up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pretty well when they call. Thought you might
have another suit with you.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, this is the best suit I have!” said
John perplexedly. “Ain’t it good enough for
him?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Ned hurriedly. “But—er—suppose
you put on another tie, old man.
Horace hates bright colors. And I’d leave off
the vest, I think. Much too hot for vests.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t often wear a vest,” replied
John as he took off his coat. “Nor a stiff
shirt, either. But mother thought I’d better
sort of spruce up, you see.” Off came the vest,
exposing a pair of pink cotton suspenders.
Ned shuddered.</p>

<p>“Got a belt with you?”</p>

<p>“Belt? No, I ain’t. Why?”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you one. You can’t wear suspenders
without a vest, of course.”</p>

<p>“I usually do,” objected John.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t done here, old man. You do
as I tell you and you’ll be all right. Let’s see
what kind of a tie you’ve got in there. Thunder!
That won’t do! Haven’t you anything
that doesn’t look like you—you’d pinched it
from a rainbow? Here, I’ll find you one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36-<br />37]</a></span></p>

<p>“The principal must be plaguey particular,”
growled John as he poured water into the
bowl and began to splash.</p>

<p>“He is; something fierce,” said Ned
gravely. “You want to look just right when
you tackle Horace or he will get miffed right
away. Here, put this on. And here’s a belt.
It’s an old one, but I guess it’ll do for this
time. Got a cap with you?”</p>

<p>“What sort of a cap?” asked John with
signs of a vanishing temper.</p>

<p>“Cloth cap, of course.”</p>

<p>“Never wear them.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will here. You’ll have to get
one. You can wear one of mine today. I’ve
got two or three, if I can find them. If I were
you I’d stick that straw in the furnace.”</p>

<p>“What for? What’s the matter with it?”
demanded John, eyeing his new acquaintance
aggressively over the edge of the towel.</p>

<p>“It looks like a last year’s bird nest,” replied
Ned firmly. “Now don’t get huffy. I’m
telling you things for your own good, old man.
You don’t want to go around having fellows
laugh at you, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, they will if you don’t tog up like the
rest of us. Here’s the cap. Now stick this belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
around— Gee, you haven’t any loops on your
trousers, have you? Never mind. Pull it tight
and it’ll be all hunky. Get a move on, Boland;
it’s most five.” Ned went to the window and
called. “Oh, you Fungus!” There was an
answering hail from below. “Going to take
him over to Horace now?” continued Ned.
“’Cause if you are we’ll go together. What?
All right. In about five minutes.” He turned
and surveyed the rehabilitated John with critical
and frowning regard. “That’s better,”
he announced, the frowns clearing away.
“You look more like now, old man. Can’t
be too careful about your togs, you know. As
old Shake said, ‘The attire doth oft proclaim
the man,’ or something like that. Let those
trousers come down another inch if you can.
That’s the stuff. Now, then, grab that cap
and come ahead.”</p>

<p>In the hall they came upon The Fungus and
young Parker. The latter was a slim, pink-cheeked,
diffident boy of thirteen who was evidently
taking his advent at Oak Park very,
very seriously and was rather overwhelmed by
his sudden plunge into the boarding school
world. The four left the house and struck off
through the park in the direction of the principal’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
residence, the chimney of which John
had spied for an instant above the trees. Ned
and The Fungus walked together, leaving the
two new arrivals to get acquainted in their
own fashion. Claire Parker was visibly embarrassed
and John was so intent on his own
thoughts that it was not until they had left
West House well behind that he considered the
conversational demands of the situation. Then
he turned and found the younger boy observing
him with shy and eager brown eyes which
were instantly lowered.</p>

<p>“I cal’late you and me’d might as well get
acquainted,” said John kindly. <a href="#i_p041">“My name’s
John Boland. What’s yours?”</a></p>

<p>“Claire Parker,” was the reply. “You
just came, too, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What do you think of the place,
Parker?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like it immensely,” was the eager
response. “Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I’ve never been to this sort
of a school before, you see. Have you?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t. I’ve never been to any
school. I’ve been taught at home. I’m awfully
afraid that it’s going to be hard. I suppose
you’ve been to school for a long time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Four years in grammar school. Where
do you live?”</p>

<p>“New York.”</p>

<p>“New York! Gee, that’s a long way off,
ain’t it? Weren’t there any schools there you
could go to?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, lots of them, but my mother
didn’t want me to go to school near home, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, she said I needed to learn how to
look after myself, and she said the best way
to do that was to go a good way off where I
couldn’t come home all the time and where I’d
have to—to get along by myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Well, I cal’late that’s a good idea,
maybe. I live at West Bayport. Ever been
there?” Claire shook his head.</p>

<p>“N-no, where is it?”</p>

<p>“About sixty miles from here, on the coast.
It’s a dandy place. Lots of city folks come
there in summer. There’s some fine big houses
on the Neck. We live in the town. I can look
right down on the decks of the schooners from
my window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42-<br />43]</a></span></p>

<p>“That must be fine! I’m crazy about boats
and the ocean. I can see some of the North
River from our house and I love to watch the
boats go up and down. I suppose you’ve been
to New York?”</p>

<p>“No.” John shook his head. “No, I ain’t
ever been there—yet. I’m going some day,
though. It must be pretty big, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Awfully! It—it’s almost <em>too</em> big. You
see, there are so many people there that you
never get to know many of them.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said John.</p>

<p>“Maybe it sounds funny, but it isn’t. One
summer mother and I went to a little place in
Connecticut, just a village it was, and after
we’d been there two or three days I knew lots
of boys, about three or four times as many as
I knew at home. I suppose if I went to school
I’d know more fellows.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I know about every fellow in
West Bayport,” said John, “and lots of fellows
on the Neck, too; fellows that just come
there summers.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess you’re never—lonely,”
said Claire wistfully.</p>

<p>“Lonely! Gee, no! I wouldn’t be, anyhow;
there’s too much to do and see. There’s always
boats coming in and going out and tugs
skipping around. And then there’s the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
salt ships from Spain and Italy and a revenue
cutter now and then; and the lighthouse
tender, too. And in summer there’s most
always some of the battleships in the harbor.”</p>

<p>“I’d like that place,” said Claire decisively.
“What did you say the name of it was?”</p>

<p>“West Bayport,” answered John proudly.
“I cal’late it’s about as nice a little town as
there is. And pretty, too.”</p>

<p>“It must be very—very interesting,” said
Claire. “Perhaps I can get mother to go there
this summer, if we don’t go abroad.”</p>

<p>“Abroad?” echoed the other. “Ever been
abroad?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, several times. I’ve been all
around over there. But I like this country
better, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t ever been in any other—yet,”
laughed John. “But I’m going some day. I’m
going to England and Turkey and the Holy
Land. And maybe Holland. Ever been in
Holland?”</p>

<p>“Not to stay very long. I liked the South
of France best of all. We stayed there all one
winter when I was about ten.”</p>

<p>“Ever been to Turkey or Palestine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I never have. I suppose you’re a good
deal older than I am, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen last March,” answered John.
“I cal’late you’re about twelve, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m thirteen. You seem—older than
fourteen. I guess that’s Doctor Webster’s
house.”</p>

<p>They had come to a rustic gate beyond which
stood a small brick house with a red slate,
many-gabled roof. Virginia creeper almost
hid the lower story and shrubs were massed
thickly under the windows. There was a lawn
in front and a great bed of scarlet sage followed
the upper curve of the drive.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said The Fungus as he held
the gate open and they passed through under
a canopy of lilac branches. “Pull down your
vests and wipe off your chins, kids, and look
respectful.”</p>

<p>They crossed the garden and ascended the
short flight of stone steps. Under the gabled
porch Ned pressed the button and waited.
Presently a maid admitted them and they filed
into the Inquisitory, as the Doctor’s library
was termed. They found four boys ahead of
them. When they had been there a few minutes
a door into a rear room was opened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a short, elderly man with kindly face and near-sighted
eyes that twinkled humorously behind
spectacles appeared.</p>

<p>“Now, then, who’s next, please?” he asked.</p>

<p>A stout boy and a thin boy arose and stood
viewing each other doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, which is it?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>“We both came in together, sir,” answered
the stout youth.</p>

<p>“So? Well, there’s more of you, my boy,
and so I’ll see you first. This way, please.”</p>

<p>John’s turn came presently and he found
himself shaking hands with Doctor Webster
and being conducted across the threshold of
a little sun-filled room that was dazzlingly
bright after the darkened library. The door
was closed and the Doctor pointed to a chair
at the side of his desk.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please. Now then, what’s your
name, sir?”</p>

<p>“John Boland, sir.”</p>

<p>“Boland?” The Doctor seated himself in
his revolving chair and referred to a book that
lay open before him. “Ah, yes, from West
Bayport; where they make the codfish for our
Sunday morning breakfasts. Well, John, I’m
glad to see you. I hope you left your—”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
another glance at the book—“your mother
well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“She tells me in her letter that you want
to go to college.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a commendable desire,” said
the Doctor heartily. “I suppose you know all
about sailing a boat, John?”</p>

<p>“I can sail a sloop, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you have that advantage over me.
Now I dare say that if you knew little or nothing
about sailing and you were put in a sloop
at, say, Boston Light and had to make your
way to West Bayport you might be able to
do it, but it would be difficult work, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I cal’late it would, sir.”</p>

<p>“You calculate it would,” said the Doctor
with a twinkle behind his glasses. “Yes.
Well, on the other hand, if you knew how to
sail that boat you’d get home safely, easily and
quickly. That’s what education does, my boy.
It teaches you how to set your sail, how to
point your craft, how to take advantage of all
the varying winds, how to meet squalls and
weather storms. Without education you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be able to travel Life’s sea, but it’s going to
be hard and you’re going to be tossed about
more than necessary. But with knowledge it’s
a good deal easier. Knowledge is power,
whether you’re sailing a sloop over Massachusetts
Bay or breasting the waves of Life. See
what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You mean I ought to study hard
and get an education.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I observe that you have a practical
mind, John. Study hard; that’s the idea.
But don’t let study be hard if you can help it.
Try and <em>like</em> study, my boy. If you were master
of a seining schooner and set out on a trip
to The Georges you’d be doing something that
would be at once pleasure and duty, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Surely. Well, see if you can’t combine
pleasure and duty here, John. It’s quite possible.
Study needn’t be drudgery. Keep in
mind that learning is like rolling a snowball
down hill. It may be slow work at first, but
it gets easier every minute, and the bigger the
snowball gets the more snow it takes up, until
when you’ve reached the bottom of the hill
maybe it’ll be all you can do to look over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
top of it. And then, if you’ve put your mind
on it, perhaps your snowball will be bigger
than anybody else’s snowball. Now, let me
see. You want to enter the First Junior Class,
I think? And your age is what? Fourteen?
Hm. Well, I think you ought to find your place
there without much trouble. But we’ll attend
to that later. You’re at West House?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s excellent. Mrs. Linn is a very
capable woman and you will like her. Who
are you to room with?”</p>

<p>“Ned Brent, sir.”</p>

<p>“Brent?” The Doctor’s brows went up
and he was silent a moment. Once he frowned
and once his hand went forth toward the telephone
on the corner of the desk. Finally,
however, he nodded his head slowly. “Well,
maybe he’s just the boy for you,” he said
thoughtfully. “We’ll see later. Ned is rather
a favorite of mine, but I’m not blind to his
little weaknesses. However— Well, that’s
all this time, I think, John. I hope you’ll get
along nicely with us and will enjoy being here.
It isn’t all study here, you know; we play football
and baseball and all the other games that
boys like; and we try to be out of doors all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
we can. Healthful bodies make healthful
minds, you know. The rules aren’t hard; we
try not to have very many. The principal one
is this, John: Be manly, straightforward and
diligent. When you find that you’ve just got
to break one of the regulations, go ahead and
break it. Then come over here and tell me
about it honestly and we’ll try to make the
punishment no harder than necessary. We
don’t expect every boy to behave like a sober
old man all the time; boys must rare and tear
a bit; all we ask is that they shall be straightforward
and honest. I’ll see you at school
tomorrow morning, John, and we’ll see how
much you’ve already learned. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>The Doctor shook hands again, the door
opened and John was once more in the darkened
library.</p>

<p>“Who is next, please?” asked the Doctor.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Supper that evening proved a very pleasant
affair, although John still felt too
strange and ill at ease to take much part in
the conversation that might be said to have
raged from the instant grace was over to the
end of the meal. The dining-room was a home-like
apartment, light, roomy, and well furnished.
There were many pictures on the
walls—not a few of them photographs of
former inhabitants of West House grouped on
the lawn or on the steps—and a leather couch
occupied the bay. A mammoth sideboard hid
the door into the parlor, which was never used,
and a small serving-table stood between the
windows at the back, through which John
looked at the edge of the oak grove. The dining-table
was long enough to seat twelve quite
comfortably, although its capacity was not often
tested. Mrs. Linn presided at the head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Fred Sanderson at the foot. At the matron’s
right sat Hooper Ross, with Otto Zoller beside
him and Ned Brent coming next. At Sanderson’s
right was Fergus White. John’s place
was next and his right-hand neighbor was
Claire Parker. Beyond Parker, Mason Halladay
completed the company. Hulda, red of
face and always good-natured, waited on table
and Mrs. Linn served. The food was plain,
well-cooked and attractively served; and there
was plenty of it. For supper there was cold
meat, a plain omelet, baked potatoes, graham
and white bread, preserved peaches and one
of Mrs. Linn’s big white-roofed pound
cakes. And each end of the table held a big
blue-and-white pitcher of milk which had
usually to be refilled before the meal was
over.</p>

<p>It was quite like a family party, and everyone
talked when he pleased, to whom he pleased
and as much as he pleased, and sometimes it
became quite deafening and Mrs. Linn placed
her hands over her ears and looked appealingly
down the length of the table at Fred Sanderson;
and Sandy served rebukes right and left
until order was restored. Tonight everyone
save the two new members of the household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had lots to say, for they had been making history
during the three months of summer vacation
and had to tell about it. Even Mrs. Linn
was more excited and voluble than usual, being
very glad to get her boys back again, and contributed
her full share to the conversation.
John contented himself with satisfying a very
healthy appetite and trying to learn something
about his companions. For a while it was exceedingly
difficult, for the boys talked in a
language filled with strange and unfamiliar
words.</p>

<p>“Another slice of the cold, if you please,
Marm,” said Ned Brent. “Pass along,
Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Any more bakes in the bowl, Marm?
They’re the slickest I’ve had since Com.”</p>

<p>“Easy there, Dutch! You’re training, you
know, and bakes are very fattening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and go light on the heavy sweet,
Dutch. I’ll eat your wedge for you.”</p>

<p>And it took some time for John to get the
fellows sorted out by names. The round-faced,
good-natured Dutch he identified easily, and
he knew that the boy who had tripped him on
the steps was called Hoop, but for a while it
wasn’t apparent whether Spud was the chubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
smiling youth sitting beyond Parker or the
tall, older boy at the foot of the table. But
at last he had the names all fitted; Hoop,
Dutch, Ned, Sandy, The Fungus and Spud.
Everyone, it seemed, was known by a nickname
save Ned Brent. He was just Ned, or, on rare
occasions, Old Ned. John wondered whether
they would find a nickname for him. He
wasn’t long in doubt.</p>

<p>After supper the fellows congregated in the
Ice Chest, the room occupied by Sandy and
Spud Halladay, John being conducted thither
by Ned. The Ice Chest had only the regular
allowance of chairs and so several of the visitors
perched themselves on the beds. John
and Claire as new arrivals were honored with
chairs, however. As school did not begin until
tomorrow, there was no study tonight and
until bedtime at ten o’clock West House might
do as it pleased. It pleased to discuss the
football situation and eat marshmallows and
salted peanuts, the former supplied by Ned
and the latter by Dutch Zoller.</p>

<p>“Say, Boland, you’ve got to come out for
football, you know,” announced Sandy. “We
need every fellow we can get this year. Think
you can play?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cal’late I can try,” answered John modestly.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Spud. “‘Cal’late,’
fellows!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it,” said Sandy approvingly.</p>

<p>“Right-o, Spud!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Only ‘cal’late’s’ too long. Make it ‘Cal’
for short,” suggested The Fungus.</p>

<p>“Got you, kid,” Spud agreed. “Make you
acquainted, fellows, with my very dear friend
Mr. Cal Boland.”</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” cried the others. John
looked about him perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Huh?” he asked finally.</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘huh,’ Cal; it isn’t done in the
best circles,” advised Dutch. “Give us a
speech.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! You’ve been christened.”</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” laughed Ned. “How
about the other, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too easy,” said The Fungus,
grinning at young Parker. “Thought you’d
all met Clara!”</p>

<p>There was a howl of laughter and Claire got
very red and distressed. But,—</p>

<p>“I—I don’t mind,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Of course you don’t.
Besides, it’s a very nice nickname and rather—rather
unusual,” said Hoop Ross. “Satisfied
with your cognomen, Mr. Boland?”</p>

<p>“I cal—I guess so,” answered John,
amidst renewed laughter.</p>

<p>“I move you, Mr. Chairman,” said Hoop,
rising and bowing to Sandy, “that the christening
exercises take place tonight.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff!”</p>

<p>“Second the motion!”</p>

<p>“Moved and carried,” proclaimed Sandy.
“All in favor— Thank you, gentlemen. The
motion is carried. The exercises will take
place tonight at the witching hour of—of
eleven-thirty at the Haunted Tarn. A full
attendance is requested. And if any fellow
forgets to turn out he will be court-martialed.
The usual regalia, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said The Fungus. “And there’s
a moon tonight. But won’t half-past eleven
be a little early, Sandy? Marm never puts out
her light until about eleven.”</p>

<p>“We’ll use the emergency exit,” said Ned
gayly. “I’ll sneak down and unlock the back
door after Queen Hulda goes to bed and we
can get in that way when we come back. Marm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
will be fast asleep by that time. Wish I was
in the pond now.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Hoop. “My, but it’s hot
for this time of year, isn’t it? When we came
back last year—”</p>

<p>“Rained like fury,” said Spud. “Remember?”</p>

<p>“Do we?” laughed Dutch. “Do we remember
your suit-case, Spud? Oh me, oh
my!”</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Sandy. “Was
I there?”</p>

<p>“No, you came up ahead. We had Red-Head’s
carriage and it was full up. Spud was
holding his suit-case in his lap, and just as we
made the turn into Elm Street it slipped—”</p>

<p>“Slipped nothing!” cried Spud. “The
Fungus shoved it off!”</p>

<p>“Why, Spud Halladay, how you talk! I
wouldn’t do such a mean trick!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, it went out,” continued
Dutch, “and there was a nice big pool of
muddy water right there and the suit-case went
<em>kerplunk</em>—”</p>

<p>“And I hadn’t shut it tight because it was
sort of crowded, and the water got inside and
just about ruined everything,” said Spud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
“Oh, it was funny—maybe. I’ll get even
with The Fungus yet for that.”</p>

<p>“Spud, I didn’t—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Fungus, and don’t lie. I saw
you,” said Hoop.</p>

<p>“I was about to remark,” said The Fungus
with dignity, “that I didn’t see the puddle. It
was—it was a coincidence, Spud.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was—not! You wait, you white-haired,
bleached out toadstool!”</p>

<p>“Spud, you can’t call me that and live,”
said The Fungus. Instantly Spud and The
Fungus were thrashing and kicking about on
the floor beside the window-seat. Proceedings
of this sort were so frequent, however, that the
others merely looked on calmly until The Fungus,
by virtue of superior size and agility, had
Spud at his mercy. “Beg pardon?” demanded
The Fungus.</p>

<p>“No, you old puff-ball!”</p>

<p>“What?” The Fungus rubbed Spud’s
short nose with the heel of his hand and
Spud writhed in a vain attempt to unseat his
enemy.</p>

<p>“Let me up!”</p>

<p>“Be good?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Apologize?”</p>

<p>“Never! Pull him off, someone.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the rough-house, you two,” said
Sandy. “Let’s go down and have harmony.
Got any new songs, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; yes, I guess so. But I’m
tired.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a tight-wad!”</p>

<p>“I’ll sing for you,” announced The Fungus
eagerly as he removed himself from Spud’s
prostrate form. But this offer met with groans
of derision and protest.</p>

<p>“If you open your mouth, Fungus, we’ll
throw you out,” said Sandy decisively.
“Come on, Ned, like a good chap.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I’m tired—”</p>

<p>“It will rest you,” said Spud. “Nothing
like music to soothe and rest you.”</p>

<p>“I know a lullaby,” suggested The Fungus.</p>

<p>“So do I,” answered Hoop darkly. “Mine’s
a club. I’m not going down if The Fungus is
going to howl.”</p>

<p>“If he tries it I’ll lick him,” said Spud. “I
can lick him, you know. You fellows saw how
I smeared him a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“How’s your old stub nose?” asked The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Fungus maliciously. Spud felt of it and made
a face.</p>

<p>“Hurts, you abominable Fungus. You just
wait!”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Sandy. “All down to
The Tomb!”</p>

<p>They trooped down the stairs and into the
parlor. Sandy turned up the light and Hoop
opened the piano.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Marm hasn’t had this old music-box
tuned,” said Ned as he seated himself on
the stool and ran his fingers inquiringly along
the keyboard. “I should say not! It’s something
fierce!”</p>

<p>“‘Hark, from the Tomb a doleful sound!’”
murmured Spud. “What you going to sing,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Something The Fungus doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” laughed Ned. “He doesn’t
know anything.”</p>

<p>“Give us something new,” said Sandy, seating
himself beside John on the couch. “He’s
a dandy singer,” he confided to the latter.
“Do you sing?”</p>

<p>“A little,” replied John modestly.</p>

<p>Ned broke into a rollicking song that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
become popular during the summer and the
others joined lustily in the chorus. In the
middle of it Dutch seized a sofa cushion and
aimed a blow at The Fungus.</p>

<p>“Cut out the parlor tricks,” cried Hoop.</p>

<p>“He was trying to sing! I heard him!”</p>

<p>“I never!”</p>

<p>“You did, Fungus! You were making awful
noises in your throat,” charged Dutch.</p>

<p>“I was trying to cough. I guess I may
cough if I want to!”</p>

<p>“You go outdoors and do it. This is a
gentlemen’s party. Give us that chorus again,
Ned.”</p>

<p>Ned obeyed and Dutch and Hoop stood guard
over The Fungus and threatened him whenever
he started to open his mouth. Mrs. Linn
tiptoed in and seated herself in a chair which
Spud moved forward for her, beaming upon
them.</p>

<p>“I do love to hear them sing,” she confided
to Claire in whispers. “I’ve always been fond
of music. My husband had such a grand
tenor voice. I wish you might have heard
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Claire. “I wish I might
have. Did he—did he lose it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who knows?” answered Mrs. Linn with
something that sounded like a sniffle. “He
had genuine talent, had Mr. Linn. And he
played the guitar something wonderful.
‘Derby Day’ was one of his favorite pieces.
It would most bring the tears to your heyes—I
mean <em>eyes</em>,” she corrected hastily.</p>

<p>“It must have been very nice,” murmured
Claire politely.</p>

<p>“Here’s a fellow says he can sing,” announced
Sandy in a lull. “Go ahead, Cal, and
do your worst.”</p>

<p>But John was embarrassed and begged off.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Ned. “What do you
know, Cal? I’ll play your accompaniment if
I can.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late you wouldn’t know my songs,”
said John.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see. What are they?”</p>

<p>“Know ‘The Wreck of the Lucy May’?”
asked John after some hesitation.</p>

<p>“No, how does it go? Come over and hum
it. Maybe I can catch on to it.” But John
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I cal—I guess all the things I know are
sort of funny,” he said apologetically. “I
know ‘Barney Ferry’; ever hear that?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Ned had to acknowledge that he hadn’t. And
he was forced to make similar admissions regarding
several other songs of John’s suggestion.
Finally, however, John mentioned
“Sally in Our Alley,” and Ned swung around
and started the tune.</p>

<p>“Got you there, Cal. Come on and sing
it.”</p>

<p>So John, who had wandered across to the
piano, cleared his throat, hunched his shoulders
once or twice and began. Hoop and Dutch
nudged each other and The Fungus winked
amusedly at Sandy. But John had a surprise
for them and the grins disappeared. He had
a good voice and had learned how to use it,
and as soon as his nervousness had been forgotten
he held his audience silent and delighted.
Sandy raised his eyebrows and nodded appreciatively
at Dutch. They all paid John the
compliment of refraining from joining in with
him and when he had finished applause was
genuine and whole-hearted.</p>

<p>“Good work, old man!” cried Sandy, slapping
him on the back. “You can do it as well
as Ned can.”</p>

<p>“A lot better,” said Ned. “He’s got a
peach of a voice. What else do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all, I guess,” answered John, smiling
with pleasure and embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Now do sing something else,” begged Mrs.
Linn, wiping her eyes. “That was just lovely.
My, the times I’ve heard that song when I was
a girl at home! Quite carries me back, it
does!”</p>

<p>“Maybe if you’ll let me sit down there,” said
John, “I can sort of find the tune. I’ll try
if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!”</p>

<p>“Sing us some of those things you spoke of,
Cal.”</p>

<p>So John took Ned’s place and sang right
through his repertoire before he was allowed
to get up. His accompaniments weren’t ambitious,
but he managed fairly well, and the songs
he sang, most of them old ballads of the sea
that he had heard all his life, didn’t demand
much of the piano to make them go. Toward
the last the others began to dip into the choruses
with him, and there was one rollicking
refrain that caught their fancy at once and for
years after remained a classic at Oak Park.
They made John sing that over and over, and
howled in unison:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yo heave ho! When the wind do blow<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“That’s a winner!” declared Hoop. “‘Yo
heave ho!’ What’s the name of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it has any name,” answered
John. “Leastways, I never heard any.”</p>

<p>“Its name is ‘Yo Heave Ho,’” declared
The Fungus. “‘Yo heave ho! And away
we—’”</p>

<p>“Kill him, someone!” begged Spud.</p>

<p>“It’s most ten, boys,” said Mrs. Linn.
“Off with you.”</p>

<p>“Now, Marm, you know this is first night
back,” begged Hoop. “We can stay down another
half-hour, can’t we? School isn’t really
begun yet.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t ask me—” began the matron.</p>

<p>“That’s so, Marm,” interrupted Sandy.
“Rules don’t count tonight, you know. We’ll
have one more song, eh? Isn’t that it, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Marm! One more song and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
then we’ll go up. Come on and gather around
the thump-box.”</p>

<p>“What’ll it be?” asked Ned, drowning Mrs.
Linn’s protests by banging chords.</p>

<p>“‘Yo Heave Ho!’” they cried. “Can you
play it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Now, then, sing the verses,
Cal, and we’ll do the rest!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Linn subsided in smiling despair and
for the tenth time they yo-heave-ho’d until
the chandelier swayed. At the final roar of
sound Sandy turned out the lights and there
was a frantic rush up the stairway.</p>

<p>“Good night, Marm! Good night!”</p>

<p>“Sleep tight, Marm!”</p>

<p>“Yo heave ho! When the wind do—”</p>

<p>“What’s for breakfast, Marm?”</p>

<p>“Chops and bakes, I hope!”</p>

<p>“Is that right, Marm? Keep mine warm,
please; I may be late!”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_67">“Yo heave ho! When the wind do blow—”</a></p>

<small>CAL IS CHRISTENED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Cal!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Wake up!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Wake up, I tell you!” Ned shook his new
roommate by the shoulder impatiently. “It’s
half-past eleven.”</p>

<p>“Wha—say, what’s the matter?” John
sat up in bed suddenly and made his inquiry
in a loud, thoroughly awakened voice, staring
dazedly about him, from the unfamiliar figure
of Ned Brent to the great path of moonlight
that flooded in through the bay-windows. Ned
clapped a hand over John’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” he said fiercely. “Want to
wake Marm?”</p>

<p>But John, still befogged with sleep, was confused
and alarmed. Where he was he couldn’t
imagine; this was not his little attic room at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
home; and who the strange figure in ghostly
attire might be he couldn’t imagine either.
Safe to say, though, that he was there at the
bedside for no good purpose; and when a hand
closed over his mouth and he was told to “shut
up,” John’s fighting blood surged within him!
The next thing that Ned knew he was flying
head over heels toward his own bed. He
landed thereon with a force that made the
springs creak protestingly and that sent him
bounding up again in the air. And when he
once more landed John was on him. There
was no time for explanations. Ned grappled
and avoided punishment by pulling John down
upon him. Then they tossed and struggled,
John striving to get to Ned’s throat and Ned
striving just as desperately to roll him off and
get the ascendancy. The bed swayed and
groaned. Once John’s fingers reached Ned’s
throat but were torn away again.</p>

<p>“Try to rob me, would you?” growled John
vindictively.</p>

<p>“Let—go!” gasped Ned. “You—crazy—idiot!”</p>

<p>“Give up?” John asked.</p>

<p>But at that moment Ned got one leg free and,
using it as a lever, sent John sprawling on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the floor between the beds. Ned tumbled off
the other side and when his roommate had
found his feet Ned was ready for him.</p>

<p>“What—what’s the matter—with you?”
he panted.</p>

<p>John looked across stupidly. His arms,
ready for another assault, dropped to his sides
and he stared about the moonlit room.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re in The Den, you wild idiot,” answered
Ned. “Where did you think you
were?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I—I didn’t know. What was the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Ned crossly. “I tried
to wake you up and you lit into me and nearly
broke my back.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said John penitently. “I—I
was kind of half asleep and—”</p>

<p>“Half asleep! Gee, I’m glad you weren’t
awake, then!” Ned chuckled. “Know where
you are now? Know who I am?”</p>

<p>“Yes, now I do,” replied John sheepishly.
“Did I—hurt you?”</p>

<p>“No, but you tried hard enough!” Ned
rearranged his pajamas. “Next time it’s
necessary to wake you I’ll let someone else do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it. You’ve pretty near torn this sleeve out by
the roots.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” muttered John. “I got
awake and saw you there and didn’t know
who you were. And then you put your hand
over my mouth and I thought maybe you were
a burglar or something. So I—I—”</p>

<p>“Tried to kill me. I know all about that,
Boland; you don’t have to tell me anything
that happened.” Ned put a foot on the edge
of the window-seat and examined an ankle solicitously.
“Well, come on now, if you’re
really awake. The others are waiting.”</p>

<p>“Where? What to do?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re going to be christened at the
pond.”</p>

<p>“Am I? I thought that was just fooling,”
said John uneasily. “Do I <em>have</em> to go?”</p>

<p>“You bet you do! And I’m going to give
you an extra ducking for the way you’ve
roughed me up, Cal. Aren’t afraid, are
you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I cal’late not, but—”</p>

<p>“Come on, then, and don’t make any noise.
It’s a wonder, though, that Marm hasn’t been
up already. It’s a good thing I thought to close
the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we ain’t—you ain’t going that way,
are you?”</p>

<p>“What way? In pajamas? Of course. And
you’re coming in that picturesque nightie of
yours. Come on.” Ned opened the door and
listened. Below stairs all was quiet, but from
the end of the hall came the sounds of low whispers
and an occasional giggle. Ned led the
way in that direction, John following. In the
Sun Parlor the rest of the boys were awaiting
them, six figures in their sleeping clothes, five
in pajamas of various shades and styles and
patterns, and one, that of Claire Parker, in a
chaste white night-gown.</p>

<p>“Thought you were lost,” whispered Sandy
as Ned closed the door behind him. “You
made a beast of a noise in there.”</p>

<p>“Yo heave ho!” chanted Spud softly.
“Who’s first down?”</p>

<p>“You,” said Hoop. “We want something
soft to fall on.”</p>

<p>“Fall on your head then,” answered Spud
as he climbed to the window-sill. “Here
goes.” He disappeared from sight and there
was a thud on the roof of the shed below, followed
an instant later by a second as Spud’s
weight dropped to the turf. One by one the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fellows followed. When it came Claire’s turn
he displayed an inclination to hold back. But
Sandy reassured him.</p>

<p>“It’s only six feet to the roof, Clara, and
about eight to the ground. It won’t hurt you,
honest. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>So Claire gathered his courage and made the
descent safely and John followed. On the
grass in the shadow of the woodshed they
waited for Sandy and Ned and then, forming
in single file, they entered the park and proceeded
along the path which John had travelled
that afternoon. Once out of sight and sound
of the house, Dutch, who was leading, began to
prance and cavort.</p>

<p>“All sing!” he called softly. Instantly the
procession started a slow and mournful chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hush! Hush! Not a sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Spirits dread are hov’ring round!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the Haunted Tarn we go<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With our victims in a row.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dark the night and dark the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Prayers for mercy never heed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We will drown them every one;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That’s the way we have our fun!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">O-o-o-oh!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last word was uttered in hollow, shuddering
tones that sent a little shiver down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
John’s back, in spite of the fact that he had
been smiling a moment before at the ridiculous
sight of half a dozen night-robed forms prancing
along in the moonlight. The effect on
Claire was apparent. He stopped and turned
a frightened face to John, who was following.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Parker,” said John reassuringly.
“It’s only fooling, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I—I want to go back.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. It’ll be fine to have a dip
in the pond. Besides, you don’t want them to
think you’re scared, do you?”</p>

<p>“N-no.” So Claire went on just as Sandy
commanded “No talking there!” The chant
began again with another verse, ending as before
in the mournful “O-o-o-oh!” The night
was warm and the park was very still. A full
moon sailed overhead and lighted the path save
where the black shadow of an oak fell across
it now and then. Walking with bare feet on
the gravel wasn’t very pleasant, but aside from
that neither of the “victims” was experiencing
discomfort. Suddenly there was a sound
of tinkling water and the pond came into view,
black and silver, with the round moon reflected
in the middle of it. The party followed the
path to the lower end where the bridge stood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The shadows were heavy there and behind
them the brook tinkled off into the darkness.
The boys drew up in a semicircle with John
and Claire between them and the edge of the
pond.</p>

<p>“Can you swim?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” John answered.</p>

<p>“A little,” replied Claire.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take you first, Cal. All ready,
Hoop and Fungus.”</p>

<p>The two named stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Want to take off that nightie?” asked
Hoop.</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’d better,” said John, suiting
action to word.</p>

<p>“Hang it on the bridge rail, Ned,” said The
Fungus. “All right now, Sandy.” The Fungus
and Hoop Ross joined hands behind John’s
back and seized him under each knee.</p>

<p>“We christen thee Cal’late,” announced
Sandy.</p>

<p>“Cal for short,” added Spud.</p>

<p>“Lean back,” said The Fungus. John
obeyed and found himself lifted off his feet.
He was swung back and forward twice and the
last time Hoop and The Fungus gave a heave
and he shot sprawling out into the dark pool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with a mighty splash. He was up in a moment
and found himself only waist deep. The water
was warm and pleasant and he struck off leisurely
toward the bridge.</p>

<p>“How is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Great! Come on in.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p079">“Please don’t throw me in,” begged Claire.</a>
“I don’t swim much.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Sandy. “We’ll take
you over there in the shallow.” So the ceremony
was repeated further around the pond,
only this time the victim was held securely by
Ned and Dutch and merely lowered into the
water and brought up again laughing and sputtering.
Then,—</p>

<p>“All in!” cried Sandy, and pajamas were
tossed aside and one after another the boys
shot into the water to emerge white and gleaming
in the moonlight far out toward the center
of the pond. It was great fun. They raced and
played tricks on each other and dived from the
bridge railing, the spray shooting up like cascades
of diamonds in the moonlight. Claire
contented himself with paddling around in the
shallows, but John was a strong swimmer and
matched his skill with the best of them. When,
having exhausted all other means of amusement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they did “stunts” from the bridge he
not only performed all the tricks that the
others did, but showed them a side-dive that
no one knew. Afterwards they crawled out on
the turf at the upper end of the pond and lay
in the shadows of the oaks and talked and spun
yarns in the warm, silent night and watched
the moon go sailing down the sky.</p>

<p>“Say,” said The Fungus, “it’s funny
neither East House nor the Hall has ever got
on to this, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Because we’ve been careful to keep it
quiet,” answered Sandy. “And that reminds
me, you two chaps. This is a secret, you know.
Not a word to anyone outside West House.
Understand?”</p>

<p>“I’ve often thought,” chuckled Spud,
“what a joke it would be if Horace or Fussy
or Jim or someone happened along some night
and found us here.”</p>

<p>“Great!” said Dutch. “We’d get fired,
though.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we would,” said Sandy.
“But Horace would make us promise not to
do it again. So I guess we’d better not get
caught at it. Wonder what time it is. I guess
we’d better be getting back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80-<br />81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s have a race to the bridge,” Dutch
proposed. “We’ll all line up here even and
Clara can give the word.”</p>

<p>So it was done and there was a wild scamper
over the grass, a plunge into the pond and a
frenzied race back across the moonlit surface,
John and Dutch and Sandy swimming a dead-heat.
Then they found their night clothes and,
holding them away from their dripping bodies,
took the path back to the cottage. By the time
West House was in sight they were dry and
they stopped at the edge of the park and
donned pajamas and night-gowns. Then they
stole towards the back of the house, across the
moonlit grass, and Dutch tried the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>“Locked!” he whispered disgustedly, turning
to Ned.</p>

<p>“Gee, I forgot to go down!” muttered Ned
sheepishly. “I had so much trouble waking
Cal that—”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder!” growled Sandy.
“This is a fine note. How do we get
in?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of the windows are unlocked,”
The Fungus suggested. “I’ll go
around and try them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take this side,” said Ned, “but I don’t
believe we’ll find one undone.” Nor did
they.</p>

<p>“All tight,” said Ned as he and The Fungus
returned. Depressed silence followed the
announcement. At last,—</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get in the way we got out,”
said Spud. “Isn’t there a ladder in the
shed?”</p>

<p>“Shed’s locked,” said Dutch. “I tried the
door.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” exclaimed Ned. “Two of
you chaps put me up on the shed roof. I think
I can make the window from there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you can,” said Sandy
doubtfully. “But you can try it.”</p>

<p>“I can do it. Then I’ll sneak down and
open the Gobblery window. You and Dutch
give me a leg-up, Sandy.”</p>

<p>Ned gained the roof without much difficulty
and the others drew off to watch him essay the
window of the Sun Parlor. To reach it he had
to jump high enough to get his fingers over the
window-ledge. He succeeded on the third attempt
and then managed to pull himself up by
his hands and squirm across. A minute later
a window close at hand was noiselessly opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and the others crawled through. Everything
progressed favorably until Ned, who was bringing
up the rear of the procession, stumbled on
the stairs. Those ahead raced frantically upward
and were out of sight when Mrs. Linn’s
door opened.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she cried anxiously.</p>

<p>Ned, rubbing his shins, replied reassuringly.</p>

<p>“It’s me, Marm; Ned; I—I’ve been getting
water.”</p>

<p>“Oh! You most scared me to death, Ned.
Did you find some?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, lots.” Ned heard an explosion
of stifled chuckles from above where seven
faces lined the railing. “Very nice water
it was too, Marm. Good night. I’m sorry
I woke you up. I didn’t mean to, but I stumbled.”</p>

<p>“Good night.” The matron’s door closed
softly and Ned went on up to be seized by the
others and gently pummeled.</p>

<p>“‘Very nice water it was!’” snickered
Spud. “Aren’t you ashamed to lie to Marm
like that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t lie,” chuckled Ned. “It <em>was</em> nice
water. I’m going to bed. Come on, Cal. Good
night, you chaps. Somebody’s got my pajamas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I guess; these don’t fit; but they’ll do
for tonight.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the only sound to be heard
in West House was the gentle snoring of Dutch.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>CAL SETTLES DOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next morning John William Boland
began his life at Oak Park School. I give
him his full title for the last time, for after
his immersion in Willow Lake he was never
anything but Cal among his friends, and it behooves
us to follow the fashion.</p>

<p>It was customary for West House to proceed
across the park to school in a body. The
bell in School Hall rang warningly at a quarter
to nine, but its tones fell on deaf ears. At ten
minutes to nine the boys gathered their books
together and began their search for caps. At
five minutes to nine they raced pell-mell out of
the house and through the park, usually arriving
in the corridor of School Hall just as
the last strokes of the second bell died away.
But this morning, being the first day of the
term, the eight boys started promptly with the
first bell and passed through the park quite leisurely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Willow Lake didn’t look at all like
the pool in which they had disported themselves
last night. In the moonlight it had seemed
to Cal big and mysterious. Today, with the
sunlight pouring down on it and a little breeze
rippling the surface, it resolved itself into a
small and quite commonplace pond, oval in
shape, neatly margined with smooth turf and
shaded with oaks and willows, the latter in
places dipping their drooping branches into the
water.</p>

<p>“I saw a whopping big trout in her last
Spring,” said Spud, leaning over the bridge
and gazing longingly into the channel below.
“I’m going to try for him some day.”</p>

<p>“Better not let anyone catch you,” said
Sandy.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you allowed to fish here?” Cal
asked.</p>

<p>“No, nor in the Mill Pond back of the Hall.
They’re full of fish, too. Some of the East
House fellows fished in the Mill Pond one
morning last Spring and got caught at it. They
got fits from Horace. They got up at about
half-past four and thought no one would see
them, but Eliza piped them from her window.”</p>

<p>“Who is Eliza?” asked Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Kendall; Grouch’s wife; she’s matron
at the Hall. Grouch teaches math.”</p>

<p>They passed out through the little rustic
gate, crossed the road and went in between the
iron posts and under the iron grilling with its
O. P. S. in monogram. The Green, as the space
between the gymnasium, the Hall and the
school was called, was dotted with boys, while
the steps of the Hall held many others. As the
company came into sight shouts of welcome
reached them from all sides.</p>

<p>“O you West House!”</p>

<p>“O you Hall!” was the answer in unison.
Right arms went up at an angle of forty-five
degrees and right hands were fluttered with a
peculiar motion from the elbow that constituted
the Oak Park form of salutation. It
wasn’t many days before Cal could do it as
well as anyone, but just now he kept his hands
in his pockets and tried to ignore the fact that
dozens of pairs of eyes were studying him critically.
As they followed the path that led
around in front of the Hall greetings and banter
fell thick.</p>

<p>“There’s Dutch Zoller! Dutch, you’re
pretty near fat enough to kill!”</p>

<p>“What do they feed you on, Dutch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“O you Fungus! How’s it going, boy?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Sandy, you old chump! Glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking mighty pale, Hoop! You
ought to see a doctor.”</p>

<p>To Cal’s surprise West House kept on its
way around the corner of the Hall, following
a path that led slightly downward toward a
smaller building set in a corner of the grounds.
There was a brook which flowed for a little
distance into what Cal surmised to be the Mill
Pond of which Sandy had spoken, and the path
passed over a tiny rustic bridge. At the bridge
the company stopped.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Sandy, and—</p>

<p>“O you East House!” they shouted.</p>

<p>Two boys tumbled out on to the porch and
waved, and in a moment others appeared and
the hail was answered.</p>

<p>“O you West House!”</p>

<p>Hands went up in friendly salutation and
then West House turned and retraced its steps,
turning to the right where the path divided,
and fetching up at the School House steps. By
this time the entrance was alive with boys,
boys of all sizes and a variety of ages, but all,
excepting a sprinkling of newcomers like Cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and Clara Parker, looking excited and merry.
Cal had stuck pretty close to Ned Brent and
now Ned introduced him to several fellows
whose names he either didn’t catch or immediately
forgot. Presently, finding that no one
was paying any attention to him, a fact which
helped to reduce his embarrassment, he wandered
into the building.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about School
House. It was the oldest of all the buildings
and the corridor was rather dark and stuffy.
Rooms opened from it at left and right, and
peeking into the nearer one, Cal saw a blackboard-lined
apartment with a platform and
teacher’s desk at one end and some forty pupils’
desks occupying the rest of the room. At
one of the boards a middle-aged man with a
scowling countenance was making cabalistic
figures with a piece of yellow chalk. Evidently,
thought Cal, that was the mathematics instructor
who went by the unattractive name of
Grouch. Suddenly overhead the bell began its
last summons. A sprinkling of boys came in,
but most of them continued their conversation
on the steps. Cal found a new object of interest
in a large pine board occupying a space
near the door. Beside it hung a pad of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and in one corner were dozens of thumb-tacks.
On the board itself were many pieces of paper
torn from the pad and impaled with the tacks.
The messages they bore were interesting to
the new boy:</p>

<p>“J. W.; meet me at noon at East House.
Taffy.”</p>

<p>“Growler Gay; Where’s my French dictionary?
Must have it today. E. M.”</p>

<p>“Spud H.; Meet me on steps after morning.
Carl.”</p>

<p>“Lost! Tennis racket with initials J. E. L.
Return to Lewis, Hall. No questions
asked.”</p>

<p>“West House Baseball. Nine plays East
House at 4. All out sharp. White, cap’t.”</p>

<p>“Class Day programmes in 12 Hall after two
on Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Bandy Jones wants to see Pills Green after
morning. Important!”</p>

<p>The notices were evidently survivals of last
term. Cal wondered whether he would ever
find his name there with a message that someone
wanted to see him. The bell stopped ringing
with a final emphatic clang and there was
a wild rush toward the class rooms. Cal flattened
himself against the notice board to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from being swept along with the throng and
Ned spied him there.</p>

<p>“Come on, Cal! This way to the fireworks!”</p>

<p>Cal struggled across and followed Ned into
a room at the end of the corridor. They were
almost the last in.</p>

<p>“Morning, sir,” said Ned, and Cal turned
to find Doctor Webster standing inside the
green leather door.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Brent,” returned the Doctor.
“Good morning, Boland. Find a seat at
the back of the room, please.”</p>

<p>The doors were closed, the Doctor mounted
the platform and struck a gong sharply and the
room became quiet. Cal found himself in a
seat on the last row, one of many new arrivals.
As he looked about him he saw heads go down,
and then heard voices join in the Invocation.</p>

<p>“O Lord, we are gathered again in Thy
presence. Help us, we pray, to make this new
day one of earnest endeavor and happy accomplishment.
Aid us to subdue all evil desires
and set our faces toward the light. For
Christ’s sake. Amen.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence the Doctor seated
himself at his big desk and in brisk and business-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
tones set the lessons for the different
classes in Latin and Greek. Afterwards the
gong was struck again and many of the boys
went out. Those that remained gave their attention
more or less closely to their books.
Then the Doctor called the new boys to him
one by one and put each through an oral examination
that soon settled the question of
their disposal. Cal had no trouble in satisfying
the Doctor as to his right to entrance into
the First Junior Class.</p>

<p>“All right, Boland. Report to Mr. James
in Room Three, please. Up the corridor to
your right.”</p>

<p>Room 3 was as large a room as the Doctor’s,
but contained only some twenty seats, of which
rather more than half were occupied when Cal
pushed the green door open and entered. In
front of the first row of desks were settees
used for recitations. At Cal’s appearance one
of the boys in the room began tapping the floor
with his foot, and instantly every other boy
followed suit. Mr. James looked around and
signalled Cal to approach the platform. The
tapping died away. The instructor was a
youngish man with the appearance of a college
athlete rather than a teacher. To the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he was known as Jim. He taught Natural Sciences,
had charge of physical training and was
Athletic Instructor. He was mightily feared
by the younger boys and loved by the older.
His habitual expression was one of severity
and he had a way of looking at a boy that
seemed to bore right through. Cal’s embarrassment
was so palpable, however, that Mr.
James softened his severity of countenance
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Doctor Horace sent me, sir.”</p>

<p>A titter of amusement swept over the room
but was silenced at a glance from the instructor.</p>

<p>“Doctor Horace?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the Doctor very well?”</p>

<p>“Huh? <em>Sir?</em>”</p>

<p>“Are you an old friend of the Doctor’s?
Known him all your life?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I never saw him until yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t you think you’d better call him
by his last name instead of his first? Did anyone
tell you to call him Doctor Horace?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—that is, Ned Brent said his name
was Horace, sir. I thought it was Webster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“You thought right. Never mind; the mistake
was natural.” Mr. James smiled.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“John Boland, sir.”</p>

<p>“Boland?” The instructor wrote on a card.
“All right. Peters!”</p>

<p>A youth at the back of the room stood up
instantly beside his seat.</p>

<p>“Boland, do you see that boy standing up?
Well, that is George Peters. Peters is one of
our stupidest boys, Boland. I think I might
say our stupidest without risking exaggeration.
That is so, Peters?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir,” replied Peters cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Now, Boland, you take the
seat at the left of Peters’. You look like a
smart fellow and I am hoping that perchance
that propinquity may result in contagion for
Peters.”</p>

<p>Cal walked down the aisle to the indicated
seat.</p>

<p>“You may sit down, Peters,” continued Mr.
James. “And, Peters, if you experience a
queer sensation don’t be unduly alarmed. It
will probably be only the germ of industry finding
lodgment in you. Should you experience
a strange impulse to glance now and then into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
your books don’t combat it; let it grow. You
understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Peters with a grin.</p>

<p>“Thank you again, Peters. You are very
amiable. Am I right in thinking that you have
your book upside-down? I can’t be certain at
this distance.”</p>

<p>Peters glanced at the book and switched it
quickly around.</p>

<p>“I was right? I thought so. Try it that
way for awhile, Peters; reading upside-down
must be difficult to even a normal intellect, and
I don’t think you ought to attempt it with
yours.”</p>

<p>Mr. James allowed his gaze to wander around
the class room with the result that some fourteen
smiles vanished abruptly from as many
faces and an equal number of heads bent over
books. Cal looked about him. Most of the
boys appeared to be of his own age, although
the unfortunate Peters was plainly a year
older. Presently he descried Ned over in a
corner, and, yes, that was Spud Halladay in
the next seat but one. He didn’t feel so lonesome
after that. Presently Mr. James came
down with an armful of books.</p>

<p>“Write your name in these, Boland, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
careful of them. We don’t allow the misuse
of text-books here. Peters, do you think that
you can tell Boland what the lessons for today
are without unduly taxing your massive intellect?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Peters.</p>

<p>“Try it, then. Have you pencils and pens,
Boland?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Come to the desk, then, and get what you
need.”</p>

<p>Cal followed the instructor up to the platform,
received an assortment of writing implements
and returned to where Peters awaited
him.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he great?” whispered Peters joyfully
as he opened one of the new books and
indicated the day’s lesson. “He’s more fun
than a circus sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you—don’t you mind his talking
like that?” whispered Cal incredulously.</p>

<p>“Mind it! Gee, no! He don’t mean anything.
Jim’s a corker!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later a gong sounded and Cal
followed the others to Room 1, where Mr. Spander,
known as Charlie, taught French and German.
There was no real work that morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and at twelve o’clock the noon gong released
them. Cal returned to West House with Ned
and Spud and found that his trunk had
arrived.</p>

<p>“Get your things out,” counselled Ned.
“Dinner isn’t until half-past.”</p>

<p>So Cal unpacked and Ned sat and looked on,
his countenance running the gamut of expressions
from surprised distaste to hopeless despair.
As a matter of fact Cal’s wardrobe
wasn’t one to elicit admiration. When the last
thing was out Ned sat huddled in speechless
disgust. Finally:—</p>

<p>“That’s your closet, Cal,” he said hopelessly.
“Put ’em away before anyone comes
in, please.”</p>

<p>Cal viewed him puzzledly.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like the room to look neat.” He got
up and went to the window and stood for a
moment frowning out at the green hill beyond
the dusty road. At last, having made up his
mind, he turned resolutely.</p>

<p>“Say, Cal, I’m a friend of yours; you know
that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I cal’late I do,” answered Cal
bewilderedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure thing, old man. Well, what I’m going
to say is for your own good. I don’t want to
hurt your feelings or anything, but—<a href="#i_p099">but, honest,
Cal, they won’t do!</a>”</p>

<p>“What won’t do?” asked Cal, pausing on
his way to the closet with his winter overcoat
in his hand.</p>

<p>Ned nodded toward the things on the floor.</p>

<p>“Those; the—the togs, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with them? Ain’t
they—ain’t they good enough?”</p>

<p>“To be quite frank, old man, they are not,”
said Ned decisively. Cal studied a moment, his
glance wandering from his roommate to the
apparel.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said at last, “but they’re
all I’ve got, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you could blow yourself
to another suit, Cal, couldn’t you? And a
sweater and cap and a few ties that don’t look
as though they were made for a circus clown,
and—”</p>

<p>But Cal shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, honest, Ned. You see, I—I
ain’t got much money.”</p>

<p>“That straight? Folks hit by the panic,
were they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about the panic,”
replied Cal seriously. “We ain’t had much
money since father was drowned.” Then Cal
explained about the legacy and what miracles
were to be performed with it; and how in summer
he was going to find work and make a
whole lot of money toward his college expenses.
And Ned listened sympathetically, a little surprised
withal, and was silent when Cal had finished.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” he said at last gravely.
“I didn’t know it was like that with you, old
man. Gee, you’re downright plucky, that’s
what you are, Cal! But— Well, there’s the
dinner bell. We’ll have to think this over.
Course you can’t spend a lot of money on
clothes; I see that, all right; but there’s some
things you certainly do need, old man, and we’ll
have to find a way of getting them. Come on.
How’s your appetite? Mine’s fine and dandy.
Take hold of the rail like this and see if you
can make it in four jumps. That’s Spud’s record.
I almost did it once, but I fell at the bottom
and bust the umbrella-stand to smithereens!
Come on! One—two—”</p>

<small>HOMESICKNESS AND GINGERBREAD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That afternoon Cal experienced his first
and last touch of homesickness. School
began at half-past one and lasted until three-thirty.
For Cal the last half-hour was spent
in the gymnasium, where he was introduced to
dumb-bells and chest-weights and taught to lie
on his back on a mattress and perform a number
of interesting and picturesque—and, at
first, extremely difficult—exercises. Each
class had three sessions a week in the gymnasium.
Cal followed the others into the dressing-room
after the class was dismissed and
made the acquaintance of a shower-bath. He
liked that so much and stayed under it so long
that he was one of the last fellows to get
dressed, and when he reached the Green Ned
and all the other West House boys had disappeared.
They were not very far away, as it
happened, having only strolled down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
athletic field below the gymnasium. But Cal
didn’t know that. Nor was he likely to discover
it, since the gymnasium hid the field from
sight. He stood around for a few minutes,
hoping that someone he knew would appear,
and at last crossed the road and returned to
West House. So far there had been no time
to feel lonesome, but now that sensation began
to envelop him. At the bridge he stopped and
leaned over the railing and let his gaze wander
around the little lake. It came to him suddenly
that he ought not to have come to Oak Park;
that he wasn’t like the other boys; that he
couldn’t dress well enough, was rough and uncultivated
beside them, and that they would
never like him. Why, even his roommate was
ashamed of the clothes he wore! He took his
elbows from the rustic railing and went on
along the path.</p>

<p>Even Claire Parker was better fitted for
these surroundings than he was. Claire had
been abroad four times, had lived in the city
and knew a hundred little things which, not
vastly important in themselves, combined to
give him an ease of manner and a conversational
ability that Cal was certain he sadly
lacked. No one, he reflected, ever cared to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to him. And when he was with the others all
he could do was to sit silent and listen to their
chatter, and wonder more than half the time
what it was about! Gee, he wished he had
never come! He wished he were back in West
Bayport this minute.</p>

<p>The house was silent and deserted when he
reached it and slowly climbed the stairs to the
Den. The bay windows were open and the
afternoon sunlight slanted in warmly under the
half-drawn shades. He tossed Ned’s cap aside,
dumped his new books on the table and seated
himself on the window-seat and gazed across
the afternoon landscape. He felt pretty dejected.
He cal’lated he was the only fellow in
school who wasn’t having a jolly good time at
that moment. Ned Brent knew about everybody
and didn’t need him a bit. Even Claire
had made friends with one or two of the
younger chaps; Cal had seen him with them
before afternoon school. No one wanted to
know him, though; no one cared whether he
was lonely and homesick! He had half a mind
to pack some things in his bag and walk back
to the town and take the first train toward
home!</p>

<p>But at that moment a door opened downstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and an eloquent odor of cooking came
up to him, an odor that brought to him a sudden
picture of the little kitchen at home and
his mother peering anxiously into the oven.
Steps sounded on the stairs and he heard Mrs.
Linn puffing her way up.</p>

<p>“Boys,” she called. But there was no answer.
Cal heard her knock on the doors at the
back of the house and then come along the corridor.
His own door was almost closed and he
hoped that she would be satisfied to leave him
in peace with his sorrow if he made no reply
to her knock. But she wasn’t. She pushed the
door wide open and saw him at the window.
And she guessed instantly what the trouble
was.</p>

<p>“Why, John, you all alone?” she asked in
simulated surprise. “Aren’t you feeling
well?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re sort of tired after your
first day here. Well, here’s something that
will make you feel lots better.” She came in
and set a great plate of smoking-hot gingerbread
on the table. “I don’t believe you ought
to eat quite all that yourself, but perhaps it
won’t hurt you.” She rolled her arms under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
her apron and looked across at him kindly. “I
suppose your mother makes gingerbread, don’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” replied Cal, looking interestedly
at the pile of red-brown cake.</p>

<p>“Then of course you like it. What is it the
boys call you? Cal, is it? Well, I shall call
you Cal too after this. Somehow I never could
seem to resist the nicknames; they’re so much
easier to remember, aren’t they? Why, I just
have to stop and think when I want to remember
Spud’s real name, or Dutch’s. Now, don’t
let it get cold. It’s a great deal better when
it’s hot. Maybe you’d like a glass of milk with
it. Would you?”</p>

<p>“No’m, thanks. I—I ain’t hungry.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t hungry! Sakes alive, what sort of a
boy are you? Why, of course you’re hungry,
though maybe you don’t know it. Here, you
try that nice crusty corner piece and tell me
whether it’s as good as your mother’s.” She
held the plate out and after a moment’s hesitation
Cal obeyed. Somehow, as soon as he
had sunk his teeth in the gingerbread his
troubles looked much dimmer. Mrs. Linn
seated herself in a chair and beamed across
at him while he ate, having first thoughtfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
deposited the plate beside him on the window-seat.</p>

<p>“You live by the ocean, don’t you?” she
asked. “That’s what I’d like to do. I’m that
fond of the ocean! I was at Old Orchard Beach
for three weeks this summer and it was just
heavenly. Seems as though I could just sit on
the sand all day long and look at the waves and
be perfectly happy! Is there a beach where
you live, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, two fine beaches.” And once
started, Cal had a lot to say about West Bayport
and the surrounding coast, and Mrs. Linn
let him talk to his heart’s content, occasionally
throwing in a question or dropping an interested
“I want to know!” And while he talked
the gingerbread on the plate grew less and less.
Finally Mrs. Linn declared that she must go
back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave the rest of that for Ned,” she
said. “But you mustn’t let the others know
about it or there won’t be any for supper.”</p>

<p>“No’m. Thank you very much. It’s awfully
nice gingerbread; just like my mother makes.
I—I like lots of molasses in it, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Molasses is just the making of gingerbread,”
asseverated Mrs. Linn. “Molasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and spices. You’ve got to be particular about
the spices too.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I cal’late you have.” He remembered
that he had observed the other boys rise
when Mrs. Linn entered or left the room and
so he got up rather awkwardly from the window-seat
and stood while she bustled out. It
was funny, he reflected, how that gingerbread
had altered the outlook. Oak Park didn’t seem
nearly so bad now and he thought that perhaps,
after all, he might be able to stick it out.
He mustn’t expect to make friends the first day.
And ten minutes later there was a sound of
noisy footsteps on the porch, and a wild rush
up the stairs and Ned and Spud burst into the
room.</p>

<p>“Where did you get to?” demanded Ned,
throwing his cap at Cal and subsiding on his
bed. “I looked everywhere for you. Spud
said he’d seen you coming over this way, but
I didn’t believe him. Spud’s such a cheerful
liar, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll believe me next time,” said Spud
resignedly. “Hello, what do I smell?” He
sniffed the air knowingly. “Smells like—”
But Ned had already sighted the gingerbread
and fallen upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’d this come from?” he asked with
a full mouth. “Marm bring it up? No wonder
you sneaked home, you foxy rascal! Spud,
he’s making love to Marm already.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but it’s good!” said Spud, munching
hungrily. “You didn’t leave much, Cal, did
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I—I didn’t think.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” laughed Ned. “If you’d
been Spud you wouldn’t have left any.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I’d like to know who fed you on
perfectly good marshmallows last night,” said
Spud indignantly.</p>

<p>“Were those yours?” asked Ned innocently.
“If I’d known that I’d eaten more
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“More! You couldn’t. You ate about half
of them as it was.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Ned, when the last crumb
had disappeared. “Let’s go down on the
porch. It’s too hot up here. What time is it,
anyway?” He looked at the gold watch he
carried at the end of a handsome fob. “Quarter
past five. Is that all? My, but I’m hungry.
I hoped it was near supper time. I wonder if
we could get Marm to let us have a few more
hunks of the heavy sweet, Spud?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“We could try,” beamed Spud. “Come
on.”</p>

<p>For once, though, the matron resisted their
blandishments and Ned and Spud sought the
porch dejectedly.</p>

<p>“How did you get on today, Cal?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“All right, I cal’late. It don’t look like it
would be very hard,” he added cautiously.</p>

<p>“It’s awful,” sighed Spud. “You simply
have to wear your young life out in study. If
it wasn’t that I want to go to college mighty
bad I’d throw up the grind and be a pirate.
Did you ever see a pirate, Cal?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the laughing reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought maybe you had. Aren’t
there any pirates at West Something—Bayport,
is it?”</p>

<p>“I never saw any. But there’s a man there
who was in a fight with pirates once.” And
Cal told about Old Captain Macon, one of the
town characters, who, in addition to having led
a highly picturesque existence as a young man,
was possessed of an equally picturesque imagination
as an old one. By ones and twos the
other West House fellows came wandering
home and joined the group on the porch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
conversation turned on school affairs and soon
Cal was listening to a fervid discussion of the
chances of the House Football Team to beat
the Hall that Autumn. If Sandy was to be
believed things were in a fearfully bad shape
and the future held nothing but gloom. But
Cal had already reached the conclusion that
Sandy’s position as head of the House had
developed an overwrought sense of responsibility
and a pessimistic attitude toward life.
Dutch, on the other hand, saw only certain
victory ahead.</p>

<p>“The Hall hasn’t the ghost of a show this
year,” he declared emphatically. “We’ve got
the men to do them up brown. Cal, you don’t
want to forget to report for practice tomorrow
afternoon right after school.”</p>

<p>“Wish they’d let us play outside teams,”
sighed Hoop.</p>

<p>“Don’t they?” asked Cal in surprise.</p>

<p>Hoop shook his head. “Not football. They
say it’s too dangerous. Don’t see much difference,
myself. Naughton bust his silly old
collar-bone last year tackling the dummy.
I dare say he’d have gone through four
or five outside games without getting a
scratch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you play other things with other
schools?” asked Cal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sandy. “Baseball and
hockey and such. I think Faculty’s right about
it, Hoop.”</p>

<p>“I know you do,” replied Hoop disdainfully.
“You think anything Faculty does is all
right.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, but I do think they’re right
about football. Why, some of the big colleges
have cut it out! And look at the way they’re
trying to make the game over!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they make me tired,” said Dutch.
“Every year they change the rules so you
never know where you are. First thing we
know we’ll be playing football with bean-bags
in the drawing-room of an evening,
with ice-cream and angel cake between
halves!”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” said Ned. “That
would be quite like cricket, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Guess Faculty would like to have us play
cricket instead,” said The Fungus disgustedly.
“Fellow Wests, I am opposed to a paternal
government.”</p>

<p>“Whatever that is,” said Spud. “Fungus
has been studying politics, fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Glad he’s studying something,” murmured
Ned. “Speaking of study—”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s not,” groaned Spud. “Let’s
speak of supper. It’s most time for it. Come
on up, Sandy, and wash your dirty face.”</p>

<p>“Everybody wash his dirty face,” cried
Hoop, jumping up. “Last man upstairs gives
me his preserves!”</p>

<p>There was a wild exodus from the porch and
a frenzied rush up the stairway, followed by a
stiff argument between Hoop and Dutch, the
latter, who had been the last to reach the top,
declaring that he had not subscribed to the
terms of the contest, and that if he had he
could easily have beaten Hoop.</p>

<p>After supper—and never, Cal thought, had
he been so hungry—there was almost an hour
of leisure. There was a doubles in tennis on
the court at the side of the house between
Sandy and Hoop and Ned and The Fungus,
and the others watched from the porch. At
eight o’clock study hour began and lasted until
nine. Cal spread his books out on his side of
the table and Ned closed the door. It was a
rule that during study hour doors must be
closed and no visiting was allowed. Then Ned
drew his chair up to his side of the table, fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the drop-light with mathematical precision in
the center of the left end of the green cloth
and—took up a story-book! Cal viewed him
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to study?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. What’s the use? I looked lessons
over this afternoon. Besides, no one is really
expected to know much the second day. Want
a good book? Ever read this?”</p>

<p>Cal hadn’t, but he resisted the temptation to
examine the picture which Ned held forth for
his inspection. “I cal’late I’d better study
this French a little. I never had much luck
with French.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” said Ned with a shrug of his
shoulders. “It’s a foolish language and
oughtn’t to be encouraged.” He leaned his
elbows on the table-top and was soon absorbed
in his book. Cal studied religiously until
Sandy put his head out of his door and
cried:</p>

<p>“Time up, fellows!”</p>

<p>Then followed a pleasant hour before bedtime.
Cal and Ned went to the Ice Chest, where
Sandy and Spud dwelt, and the rest of the
House joined them there. The evening ended
in a grand rough-house up and down the corridor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and in and out of the rooms, and Cal,
wielding a pillow in the thick of the fight, quite
forgot that he had ever been either lonesome
or homesick.</p>

<small>NED LAYS DOWN THE LAW</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Football had heretofore remained outside
Cal Boland’s philosophy. There had
been a game now and then at home, but for the
most part the high school team had journeyed
to other towns to play their contests and Cal
had never watched more than two or three in
his life. His conception of the game was very
vague when he reported at the lower end of
the athletic field for practice the next afternoon.
As he owned no football clothes he
merely laid aside coat and cap and rolled his
shirt-sleeves up. <a href="#i_p117">Ned viewed his costume with
misgiving</a>, but made no comment as they went
together down to the field.</p>

<p>As Oak Park played no contests with outside
football teams all the interest concentrated on
the inter-dormitory games. West and East
Houses combined forces against the Hall, with
whom they played a series of three games for
the school championship and the possession of
what was known as the Silver Shield. This
was an oak shield bearing a smaller shield of
silver surrounded by a design of oak leaves
and acorns—the school emblem—and the inscription:
“Oak Park School Football Trophy.”
Each year the shield was inscribed with
the names of the winning players and became
the temporary property of Hall or House, as
the case might be. For two years running the
Silver Shield had graced the parlor of the Hall,
and the Houses were resolved that this Fall
it must come down. As East House accommodated
only fourteen boys and West House but
eight, while the Hall held thirty-eight, at first
glance the chances seemed to favor the Hall
from the start. But the discrepancy was not
as great as would appear, for the Hall held
most of the younger boys, members of the
Second Junior Class, who were not allowed to
take part in the big games but were permitted
to play amongst themselves. So that actually
the Hall’s supply of football material was usually
not much larger than that of the combined
Houses.</p>

<p>The House Team was captained this year by
Frank Brooks, an East House lad of seventeen
who was usually known by the title of Brooksie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The Hall’s captain was Pete Grow, House
Leader at the Hall and one of the best-liked
fellows in school. There were two separate
gridirons on the athletic field and it was an
unwritten law that during athletic activities no
Hall man should approach the House gridiron,
and vice versa. The House used the lower field
and it was on that that Cal began his initiation
into the mysteries of football. I can’t say that
he displayed any especial aptitude for the game
or was very enthusiastic about it. He did as
he was told to do to the best of his ability and
perspired freely for the cause, but Frank
Brooks didn’t single him out for commendation
that day. On the way back to West House
after they had had their showers Cal gave expression
to his curiosity.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Ned,” he remarked, “that
football playing’s pretty hard work. I always
thought, to hear about it, that it was fun.”</p>

<p>“Why, it is fun!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Cal. “Is it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, after you get to know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t see much fun in it today.
Dropping on a wobbly leather ball that’s never
where you think it is and running across the
field after it with the thermometer at—whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it is at, isn’t my idea of having a real good
time, Ned.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you haven’t got into it
yet,” said Ned encouragingly.</p>

<p>“I cal’late I never will. I didn’t seem to
have much luck today.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did well enough for a beginner,”
answered Ned. “Most fellows have a pretty
hard time at first. You never played before,
did you?”</p>

<p>“No, and I guess I’ve had enough already.
I cal—guess I’ll let the rest of you have the
fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t back out,” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Cal asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because we need you; we need every fellow
we’ve got, and more too. Why, if Clara
Parker wasn’t a Second Junior we’d have him
at work!”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any use in my trying
for the team,” said Cal. “I’d never make
it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. We’re going to be in a
hard way for men this year. You’d better
stick it out, Cal. Besides, the fellows wouldn’t
like it if you squealed.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t? Well, I don’t see as it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
anyone’s business but mine. If I’d rather
not—”</p>

<p>“You haven’t anything to say about it,” declared
Ned firmly. “As long as the House
needs you it’s your duty to come out. Of
course, you’re new yet and don’t understand
the way we feel about such things here. You
see, Cal, it’s the School first and then your own
particular House; see? After that you can do
as you like personally.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Cal thought that over a moment,
and then chuckled. “I see. After I do what
the School wants me to do then I do what the
House wants me to do, and then, if there’s any
time left, I do as I please. That’s it, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure pop,” answered Ned gravely. “And
it’s a good thing to remember, old man.”</p>

<p>“Supposing my mother didn’t want me to
play football; and I ain’t sure that she does;
then what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if she wrote to Horace he’d tell Brooksie
and Brooksie would let you off,” answered
Ned carelessly. “But I wouldn’t try that
game,” he added meaningly, “because the fellows
would think you’d put your mother up
to it.”</p>

<p>“Seems, then, like I’ve just got to go ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and be a martyr,” sighed Cal with a rueful
shake of the head. “Look here, Ned, ain’t
there any nice quiet position I could fill without
having to bump my breath out and skin my
shins all up? How about official scorer? Ain’t
there something like that on the team? I cal’late
I’d make a fine official scorer.”</p>

<p>“You’ll make a fine chump of yourself if
you don’t stop talking,” said Ned with a laugh.
“Do you play tennis? I’ll try you a set before
supper if no one has the court.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how. Besides, I couldn’t play
after what I’ve been through back there. Why,
I’m all lame and bruised up!”</p>

<p>Ned slapped him on the back.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll get used to it,” he laughed,
“and just love it, old man! You wait and
see.”</p>

<p>“Love it nothing!” said Cal disgustedly.
“I cal’late I’ll have to keep on, but I’m plumb
sure I ain’t ever going to get to love it! Besides,”
he continued as they sat down on the
steps of West House, “I don’t see any sense
in it! I thought football was play, but you
fellows go at it like it was a matter of life or
death.”</p>

<p>“Because we want to beat the Hall this year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and get the shield away from them. You wait
until later and you’ll be just as crazy as any
of us. Things get pretty well heated up along
towards November. If we win a game and
Hall wins a game, why, you won’t be able to
eat or sleep for two days before the play-off!”</p>

<p>“I won’t?” grunted Cal. “Huh; you just
watch me!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get a football suit,” said
Ned thoughtfully. “They don’t cost much,
though. You can get one that’s good enough
for about four dollars.”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said Cal with a satisfied
sigh. “That lets me out. I haven’t got four
dollars for football clothes.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here,” exclaimed Ned sternly.
“You’re rooming with me, Cal Boland, and
I’ve got to look after you. And you’ve got to
do as I say, and you might as well understand
that right now. You’ll go down to the village
tomorrow before morning school and get a pair
of canvas breeches and a jacket. You ought
to have shoes, too, but I think I’ve got a pair
upstairs that’ll fit you all right.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t afford it!” objected Cal.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to afford it,” answered Ned
sternly. “What’s four dollars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s more’n I’ve got to throw away on
football things,” Cal replied with a shake of
his head. “I cal’late it don’t seem much to
you, but four dollars looks big to me, Ned.
Besides,” he added after a moment, “I’ve
been thinking about a suit. I cal—I guess
you’re right about my clothes being pretty bad.
I’ve been looking around and I see that the
fellows here pay a lot of attention to what they
wear. Some of ’em seem to wear their best
clothes all the time! Well, I was thinking I’d
write home and see what my mother thought
about my getting a new suit. You see, Ned,
I don’t want you to be ashamed to have me
room with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! Of course I’m not ashamed.
But I do think you ought to have another suit,
a sort of knock-about suit you could wear every
day, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, if I get that I surely can’t go
buying any football clothes.”</p>

<p>“Now wait, Cal. There’s a place in the
town where you can get a mighty good looking
suit for about twelve dollars. Of course, it
isn’t a wonder, but it will do well enough.
Twelve dollars is pretty cheap, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, I cal’late it is,” replied Cal doubtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
“That’s about what I paid for these.”
He looked thoughtfully at his gray flannels.
“And I’ve worn ’em two summers.”</p>

<p>“They’re very nice,” said Ned with an effort.
“But I wouldn’t get light gray if I
were you, Cal. You see, you’re sort of light
yourself and darkish things would look better
on you.”</p>

<p>“They show the dirt, though.”</p>

<p>“Not if they’re kind of rough and mixy,”
said Ned. “If you could get a suit for twelve
you could easily afford to buy the football togs,
couldn’t you?” But Cal looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“I was cal’lating to spend about twelve altogether,”
he replied. “Then you said I ought
to have a cap and a belt and some neckties;
though seems to me I’d better wear what neckties
I’ve got; I’ve got a whole lot of ’em; about
six or seven, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Never mind those things now,” said Ned.
“As for the cap, why, you might just as well
wear that one you’ve got on as buy a new one.
It fits all right, and I don’t need it. And the
belt the same way. It isn’t a very good one,
but it will do well enough. And you can buy
a couple of ties any old time. Look here, Cal,
if you’re hard-up just now, there’s a fellow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
town who will trust you if you want him to.
Of course he will charge you a little bit more
for what you get, and you mustn’t say anything
about it to anyone, because it’s against the
rules to get things on credit.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” said Cal. “Besides,
I’ve got as much now as I will have all winter.
More, I guess,” he added ruefully. “I suppose
I couldn’t play football in what I’ve got?
There’s an old pair of trousers upstairs—”</p>

<p>But Ned shook his head firmly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be done. You can’t work in tight
things, and they won’t stand the strain. No,
you’ve got to have togs, Cal.”</p>

<p>“Have, eh?” Cal looked disappointed.
“Well, all right. I wish I didn’t, though. You
see, I thought I’d get mother to send me ten
dollars. Then I’ve got pretty near three dollars
left from my trip. And that ought to be
enough. If I just got the suit, you know. But
if I’ve got to have football things—” He
stopped and shook his head puzzledly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get her to send you fifteen instead
of ten?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I oughtn’t to spend that much on
clothes.” He put his hand into his coat pocket
and pulled out an old red leather wallet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
found two one-dollar bills folded away in a
recess. “Thought maybe I might be mistaken,”
he said. “Thought maybe there might
be another one there.” Then he counted the
silver in his trousers pocket. “Eighty-five
cents,” he mused. “That ain’t much, is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ned, frowning. “But,” he
added with a laugh, “you’ve got eighty-five
cents more than the law allows.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Rules don’t let us have more than two dollars
spending money,” replied Ned carelessly.
“We’re supposed to hand the rest over to
Marm and she doles it out to us. But no one
pays any attention to that. I’ve got about
eight dollars upstairs in my collar-box.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” Cal’s eyes got big. “Ain’t you
afraid to lose it?”</p>

<p>“No; why? How could I lose it? It’s in
my bureau drawer.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to have that much lying
around, though,” Cal said. “I’d be mighty
nervous about it.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Ned. “I’ll lend you
a couple of dollars so you can get your football
togs in the morning. You can pay me back
later, when you get your money from home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to do that,” said Cal. “If
I write tonight I guess maybe I’d get the money
by day after tomorrow; or next day, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use in waiting all that time.
Besides, you need the things right away; you
can’t play in ordinary clothes. You let me
lend you two dollars and then you kite down
town in the morning; I’ll go along if you like.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Cal reluctantly.
“I’m much obliged to you. And I cal’late
you’d better come along and show me where
to go. I wouldn’t want to get into any high-price
place.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Ned, “I’ll look after
you, old man. Here comes Spud and The Fungus.
O you Spud! Want to play a set?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got you,” answered Spud. “Going
in for your racket? Bring mine out, will you?
It’s in the stair closet or back of the door or—somewhere
around.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say?” inquired Ned sarcastically.
“You’re sure it isn’t in the trunk-room
or under the refrigerator or in my pocket?
You’d better come in and look for it yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, honest, Ned, it’s right there somewhere.
If you can’t find it, bring The Fungus’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do and you’ll get licked,” said The
Fungus grimly as he seated himself in the hammock.
“Say, fellows, has anyone glanced over
the apple crop this Fall?” Spud’s gaze followed
the Fungus’s over the whitewashed
picket fence that marked the boundary of
school territory at the left of the cottage.
There was a hedge of lilac bushes on the other
side of the fence which hid the next door domain
from the porch. But Cal knew what was
beyond, for from the bay window of the Den
he could look over the hedge and through the
trees at the old-fashioned white farm-house
with its green shutters and its columned
porch.</p>

<p>“Who lives over there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The Old Maids,” replied Spud. “There
are two of them. Their name is Curtis.
They’re Tartars, too. They’ve got a dandy
apple orchard back of the house and they’re
very, very stingy with the fruit thereof.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t do them much good, though,”
said Ned, returning with the two rackets. “We
usually get all we want.” The Fungus chuckled.</p>

<p>“Rather! And we ought to be seeing how
those nice big red apples are coming on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
They’re usually ready for us about the first
of October, aren’t they, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.” He lowered his voice. “We
might drop over tonight and investigate. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Good scheme! I couldn’t do a thing to a
couple of those pippins! I wonder if they’ve
nailed up the gate again.”</p>

<p>“Sure! We’ll have to climb, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better stroll along and find a
good place to get over. Last year I tore my
bestest panties on a picket. Come on, Cal;
you and I’ll look things over while those
chumps try to play tennis.”</p>

<p>“What is it you’re going to do?” asked
Cal as he followed The Fungus around the corner
of the house and across the grass toward
the fence and hedge.</p>

<p>“Why, find a place where we can get over
the fence easily and not get tangled up in the
hedge. We all take pillow-cases over and fill
them with apples, you know. They’re dandy!
Only, you want to be sure that you can get
over the fence again in a hurry because the
Old Maids are painfully suspicious of us West
Housers. One year the hired man caught two
fellows and locked them up in the shed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
telephoned to Horace. And they got the dickens;
pretty near fired, they were. If you get
caught over there now it means suspension, at
least.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather dangerous, then, isn’t it?”
asked Cal.</p>

<p>“Sure. That’s what makes it such good
sport,” replied The Fungus easily. “Look;
<a href="#i_p133">here’s a place where there’s a picket off</a>. If
we could get the next one off— There it is;
bully! We can crawl through there easy as pie.
It’s only a little way to the orchard. If you
peek through the lilacs you can see the trees.
Gee, look at those apples! There’s a million
billion bushels of them! See the tree down
toward the brook, the one with the red, red
apples on it? That’s the best in the orchard.
Say, there isn’t any moon tonight, is
there?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but it doesn’t come up until
pretty late.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then. Wish those lilacs
weren’t so thick right here,” he said. “But I
guess we can squirm through. Hello, what was
that?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134-<br />135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought I saw something in there, something
white. And listen!” He peered into
the shadow of hedge and trees. “Didn’t you
think you heard something?”</p>

<p>But Cal shook his head.</p>

<p>“I guess I just imagined it,” said The Fungus.
“Now let’s fix this place in our minds,
Cal. If we walk diagonally across from the
woodshed toward the big chestnut tree we’ll
get it all right, won’t we? That’s easy. Don’t
forget to bring your pillow-case tonight. We’ll
come over here about half-past ten.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe I will,” said Cal. “I
wouldn’t want to get suspended, you see.”
The Fungus viewed him amazedly.</p>

<p>“Who would?”</p>

<p>“Well, you said if we got caught—”</p>

<p>“<em>If!</em> But we’re not going to get caught.
That’s the difference. Oh, you’ll come all
right. If you don’t, you’ll be awfully sorry
when you see the apples we bring back.
They’re perfect corkers! Those big red
ones—” But words failed him and he contented
himself with licking his lips and looking
unutterable bliss.</p>

<p>“Do the women live there all by themselves?”
asked Cal as they returned to the
tennis court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, with some servants. There’s a big
truck-garden beyond the orchard and another
house where the hired man lives. They’ve got
about fifteen acres there, I think. They’re awfully
rich, the Old Maids are. They own about
half the clock factory back of town, by the
river. You’d think they’d be more generous
with their apples, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’d give us some if we went and
asked,” replied Cal innocently.</p>

<p>“Huh! Who wants apples that are given to
you? All the fun comes in swiping them and
not knowing whether someone is going to pop
out at you any minute!”</p>

<p>Sandy, Dutch, Hoop and Claire were watching
the tennis when the two conspirators returned
to the front of the cottage and The
Fungus at once announced the gleeful news of
a raid on the orchard “at half-past ten by the
old town clock.” Sandy, as became his years
of discretion—he was sixteen—looked doubtful,
but the rest were so heartily in favor of
the adventure that he was forced to give his
sanction in order to save his dignity and authority.</p>

<p>“It’s risky, though,” he declared with a
frown. “We’ll have to be mighty quiet. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the Old Maids hear us they’ll tell Horace, as
sure as shooting.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” Hoop ridiculed. “They
can’t prove it was us if they don’t see us.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that we’re under suspicion,”
said Sandy.—“Good stuff, Spud!
That was a dandy!—They’ll say it was us
and Horace will ask us. Then what?”</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence and
everyone seemed to prefer to watch the tennis
rather than face the question. At last Hoop
said:</p>

<p>“Well, preservation is the first law of Nature,
or something like that. If he asks me
I’ll tell him I don’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do that,” said The Fungus,
shaking his head disapprovingly. “You can’t
lie about it, you know. Especially to Horace.
He—he expects you to tell the truth and you
just have to do it. The only way is to keep so
quiet that they won’t hear us. And the place
I’ve found where we can get through the fence
is so far from the house that they’re not likely
to know anything about it. And it will be
plumb dark, too. Hard luck, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Game and set,” panted Ned. “I guess
there isn’t time for any more, Spud. I’ll try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
you again tomorrow, though, you Mr. Good-player.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Dutch.</p>

<p>“Seven—five,” said Spud. “Gee, I’m
warm! What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Supper time; there’s the bell,” answered
Ned. “Tell Marm I’m changing my clothes,
Sandy. And don’t you swipe my butter,
Dutch!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE GHOST IN THE ORCHARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“At half-past ten by the old town clock,”
in the words of The Fungus, eight figures
might have been dimly seen emerging from
the dining-room window and crossing the turf
toward the lilac hedge. They might have been
seen, but weren’t; which was just as well for
the little band of marauders. In some pocket
each member of the desperate company carried
a pillow-case. Their coats were buttoned close
and no tell-tale expanse of linen was allowed
to show. One by one they bent and squirmed
through the hole in the picket fence and as
silently as possible negotiated the lilac hedge.
The latter wasn’t an easy task, for the bushes
were close together and the branches had managed
to form a fairly impregnable barrier. But
at last they were all through, Claire Parker
bringing up the rear with his heart in his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and his eyes staring anxiously about in the
darkness. Between them and the back of the
house, which, like many old residences thereabouts,
consisted of a series of additions running
back from the main house in an ever
diminishing fashion and terminating in a disused
granary, was a fair eighty yards of turf
and garden, while beyond the orchard of pear
and apple and plum trees, interspersed with
small fruits, was near at hand. They halted in
the deep shadow of a group of shade trees that
stood near the hedge and listened. Not a sound
was to be heard from the direction of the house.
The moon wasn’t in sight, although in the east
the sky showed light. Stars peered down at
them here and there, but for the most part
clouds covered the sky. At the front of the
house yellow light shone out on the drive.</p>

<p>“All quiet along the Potomac,” whispered
Spud. “Let’s hurry before that moon butts
in and spoils things.”</p>

<p>“Better keep in the lower side of the orchard,”
advised Hoop. “Then they can’t see
us possibly.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Besides, the big red apples are
down there at the corner. The others aren’t
worth fooling with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, then,” said Sandy. “I’ll go
ahead. Keep quiet, fellows. Stop your whispering,
Dutch.”</p>

<p>The band crept forward, hugging the deeper
gloom of the trees until they had reached the
end of the orchard. Once there, there was a
quick and silent rush for a certain big tree that
grew the apples they best liked. Out came the
pillow-cases and hands searched the ground
for fallen fruit. But there was little of
that yet, for there had been no rain or wind
storms.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to shake?” asked Spud
softly.</p>

<p>“Let Clara do it,” said Hoop. “He’s
small and can shin up easily.”</p>

<p>“I—I’d rather not,” said Claire nervously.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” Cal volunteered. “You take
my bag, Ned.” He had soon worked his way
to the crotch of the tree and from there he
walked out on one of the branches and jarred
it by jumping up and down. The apples fell
in a veritable shower, and Spud, who had been
looking up, received one fairly and squarely on
the tip of his nose and said “Gee!” so loudly
that he was threatened with awful things if he
didn’t keep quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess you’d yell if a big old apple hit you
on the nose,” he muttered aggrievedly as he
filled his pillow-case.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you idiot! Give her another
shake, Cal!” said Sandy.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute and I’ll try another
branch.” There was a rustling as Cal moved
cautiously about the tree and then another rain
of fruit began. “Anyone filling my bag?” he
asked in a whisper. But his question was never
answered, for somebody—it sounded like The
Fungus, though he always maintained that he
never opened his mouth—let out a screech of
terror, and <a href="#i_p143">panic seized the company</a>. Cal, with
the branches adding to the darkness about him,
saw nothing, but the sound of footsteps pounding
the ground told him that he was being deserted
by his comrades. Once someone fell and
there was a smothered exclamation of alarm,
and then there reached him the sound of crashing
branches as the boys fled helter-skelter
through the lilacs and surmounted the fence as
best they might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_142">Panic seized the company</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144-<br />145]</a></span></p>

<p>Cal’s first thought was to drop to the ground
and race after them, for he didn’t need to be
told that danger was at hand. But by the time
he was ready to swing himself down the others
were half-way to the fence and he realized that
safety lay in remaining where he was, hidden
in the dark foliage of the tree. With his heart
pounding so that he feared it would proclaim
his whereabouts to the pursuit, he waited and
watched. For a full minute he heard nothing
and saw nothing. Then a sound reached him,
a sound that resembled a chuckle, and to his
overwrought ears a most diabolical chuckle at
that, and an instant later there came dimly
into sight a ghastly white form that almost
caused him to fall out of the tree from sheer
terror.</p>

<p>The moon was almost at the horizon and a
ray of light slanted through an opening in the
trees and illumined the form for a brief moment.
It stood almost under the tree and while
he watched, his eyes almost popping from his
head and his heart standing still, it grew
smaller and smaller until it was only two or
three feet high, and then in an equally mysterious
way lengthened again, fluttered under
his gaze for a moment and then was hidden by
the branches.</p>

<p>Cal didn’t believe in ghosts, of course; what
sensible boy does? But there was something
frightfully uncanny about that white-robed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
figure and the noiseless way in which it came
and went. For it had gone, although Cal didn’t
know how far and would have given a good
deal to find out. There were drops of cold
perspiration on his forehead, a queer twitching
at his scalp that felt as though his hair was
trying its best to stand on end, and uncomfortable
shivers up and down his spine. He tried
to laugh at himself, but the laugh wouldn’t
come. He clutched the branch tightly and
waited what seemed an eternity. Once he was
almost certain that he heard the closing of a
distant door, but he didn’t intend to run any
risks. And so it was a good five minutes after
the alarm that he finally dropped to the ground,
looked fearfully around him for sight of the
dread figure and then bolted as fast as his legs
would take him for the hedge and the fence
and safety! There was no thought of avoiding
noise. He crashed into the hedge and through
it, scrambled over the fence—just how he
didn’t know—and fled across the turf to where,
under the dining-room window, seven agitated
comrades awaited him. When he saw them he
drew up and strove to complete his arrival
more calmly.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?” cried The Fungus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was it?” demanded the others.
“Did it catch you?”</p>

<p>“You bet I saw it!” panted Cal. “It came
right under the tree and stood there and got
little and then got big again and just disappeared
like—like that!” And he waved his
arm.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” whispered Spud hoarsely.
“What do you suppose it was?”</p>

<p>“It was a g-ghost,” sniffled Claire.</p>

<p>“Ghost your granny!” ridiculed Sandy.
“It was somebody with a sheet around them,
that’s what it was. Anyhow, we’re all in for
trouble.”</p>

<p>There was gloomy accordance with this, but
the subject of the mysterious visitant was too
interesting to keep away from.</p>

<p>“I looked up and saw it between the trees,”
said The Fungus, “and maybe I wasn’t
scared!”</p>

<p>“I guess you were!” said Sandy. “You
let out a yell that they could hear in
town.”</p>

<p>“I never! I didn’t open my mouth! I was
too blamed scared!”</p>

<p>“Well, someone did,” said Dutch. “And
it wasn’t me, for I never saw anything. I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
someone yell and then everyone ran and I
grabbed my bag and ran too.”</p>

<p>“You saw it, didn’t you, Hoop?”</p>

<p>“Sure! About seven feet high it looked and
sort of phosphorescent.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice that,” said Cal doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t see it the way we did, I
guess,” said Hoop in a tone of pride. “You
were up in the tree.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I saw it better than anyone,”
responded Cal indignantly. “Didn’t it come
and stand there right under me almost for two
or three minutes?”</p>

<p>“Gee! Did it, honest?” asked Ned. “I
didn’t get more than a glimpse of it. That was
all I wanted, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get upstairs,” said Sandy, “before
anyone comes and finds us here.” They
climbed in the window, each casting an anxious
glance toward the orchard as he did so, and
then stole noiselessly upstairs. Strange to say,
each boy had brought his bag of apples safely
away save Cal.</p>

<p>“I was too scared to even drop mine,” explained
Spud, “and I didn’t know I had it
until I got to the fence.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said The Fungus. “It’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
good thing we didn’t leave the pillow-cases
over there, though, for they’ve all got ‘West
House’ marked on them as plain as daylight.”</p>

<p>“Who has got mine?” asked Cal at this
juncture. They had all congregated in Sandy’s
room and were sitting around wherever they
could find space. Spud had lighted the gas
and turned it half down. At Cal’s question
each fellow looked at the other while dismay
settled rapidly on every face. “I gave it to
you, Ned, you know,” Cal went on anxiously.
Ned shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>“I know,” he answered. “I was going to
fill it, but I couldn’t fill both at once and so
I leaned yours against the tree. I—I guess
it’s right there now!”</p>

<p>A deep silence held the group, broken at
length by a sigh from Claire.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d never gone,” he murmured miserably.</p>

<p>“I guess we all wish that—now,” said
Sandy dryly. “If the Old Maids find that
pillow-case there’ll be the dickens to pay.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” asked Dutch gloomily.
“Someone saw us swiping the apples and
saw us come over here. That pillow-case will
only be supervacaneous evidence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t use bad words, Dutch,” said Hoop
sternly.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Sandy, “someone
ought to go over and bring that back, I
think.”</p>

<p>There was no enthusiasm displayed. The
silence grew embarrassing.</p>

<p>“Whose pillow-case was it?” asked Hoop
finally.</p>

<p>“Mine,” answered Cal.</p>

<p>“Well, then you’d better go back and get
it. If you don’t you may get us all into worse
trouble than we’re in. We don’t know for sure
that that thing—or person, or whatever it was,
really saw us come over here. But if the Old
Maids find that pillow-case under the tree with
‘West House’ marked on it in indelible ink
they’ll have us bad.”</p>

<p>Cal looked as though he scarcely relished the
suggestion and Ned came to his rescue.</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” he said. “I ought to
have looked after it, especially as Cal was shaking
down apples for us, and I’ll go back for
it if some of you fellows will go as far as the
fence with me.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go and get it,” said Cal, rising.
“I don’t mind—much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll go together, then,” declared Ned
more cheerfully.</p>

<p>So back they went, downstairs and out the
dining-room window and across the grass to
the broken palings, keeping very quiet, and not
especially happy, either of them. But when
they emerged from the hedge and stood in the
shadows and viewed the scene there was nothing
to alarm them and they gained courage.
Besides, the moon was over the horizon now
and the orchard was palely illumined.</p>

<p>“Ghosts don’t come out when it’s as light
as this, I guess,” Ned whispered.</p>

<p>“I cal’late it wasn’t really a ghost,” replied
Cal, “but it looked awfully like one, didn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get a real good look at it,” answered
Ned. “Come on and let’s get it over.”
They stole along to the edge of the orchard and
then rushed quickly to the protecting darkness
of the trees. It was so light now that they
could distinguish objects on the ground, but
search as they might the missing pillow-case
was not to be found.</p>

<p>“I left it right here,” whispered Ned, tapping
the trunk of the apple tree with the toe of
his sneaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are a lot of apples here but no pillow-case,”
said Cal. “Looks like someone had
dumped the apples out and taken the case away,
don’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what’s happened,” said Ned disgustedly.
“I guess we might as well go back.
We’ll look on the ground between here and the
fence, though. Someone might have grabbed
it up and dropped it later.”</p>

<p>But there was no sign of it and in the end
they had to return to the house without it.</p>

<p>“Well, I dare say it won’t make much difference
anyway,” observed Sandy pessimistically
when they reached the Sun Parlor again
and reported their ill-success. “We’re all in
for a jolly ragging and something worse.”</p>

<p>“He can’t suspend us all,” said Spud hopefully.</p>

<p>“Why can’t he?” asked Hoop.</p>

<p>“Too many of us. It would depopulate the
school, to say nothing of West House.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t bother Horace,” said The
Fungus. “If he wants to send us home he will
do it, Spud.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, let him then.” Spud reached into
his pillow-case and drew forth a big red apple,
which he first polished on his knee and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
dug his teeth into. “Eat, sleep and be merry,
for tomorrow we die. I’m going to bed. Come
on, Sandy.”</p>

<p>“Might as well, I guess, although I don’t
suppose I’ll be able to sleep any.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t do any good to stay awake,”
replied Spud carelessly as he took up his bag
of apples. The others followed his example,
whispering good nights in the corridor, and
sought their rooms. Ned cleaned out one end
of his bottom bureau drawer and emptied the
contents of his pillow-case into it, afterwards
restoring the case to its rightful place.</p>

<p>“You can have half of these, Cal,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I cal’late I ain’t got much
appetite for apples,” was the sad reply. “I
hate to have to go home just after I’ve got
here, Ned. How long do you think he will send
us away for?”</p>

<p>“Maybe a month or two; maybe until after
Christmas vacation,” answered Ned. “It’s a
beast of a note, isn’t it? Whose idea was it,
anyway, to go over there tonight?”</p>

<p>“Yours,” said Cal with a wan smile.</p>

<p>“Was it? I dare say. I’m always getting
into trouble, hang it all! Well, I’m going to
hit the hay. Sufficient unto the day is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
trouble thereof. Good night.” And Ned tumbled
into bed, drew the sheet up to his ears
and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>To Cal, however, slumber didn’t come so
readily. He was sorely worried. If Doctor
Webster sent him home for the rest of the term
it would mean that he would miss half a year
of school and more than likely be set back just
that much in class. Besides which he would
have wasted more of his small capital than he
could afford. Eventually sleep came to him,
after a distant clock in the town had struck
twelve, and he passed a restless night disturbed
by unpleasant dreams, to awake in the morning
unrested and oppressed by a sense of impending
misfortune that he couldn’t account
for until recollection of the preceding night’s
adventure returned to him. The boys gathered
in the parlor every morning before breakfast
for prayers. They took turns at reading a passage
from the Bible and then knelt while Mrs.
Linn offered earnest if somewhat rambling
invocation. That morning Cal added a little
prayer of his own in which a promise of future
good conduct was made in return for present
escape from punishment. Breakfast was an
unusually quiet meal and Mrs. Linn viewed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
downcast countenances of her eight boys with
deep concern but failed to elicit from any of
them a satisfactory description of their symptoms.
Only Spud ventured a reason.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m feeling pretty well, thanks,” he
said. “I didn’t sleep extra good, though.
Fruit doesn’t agree with me.” And he winked
wickedly at Dutch and received a scowl in response.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to them all to find that
things looked much the same as usual at School
House. Mr. Fordyce, known as Fussy, passed
them on the steps, smiled amiably and went
on quite as though the world wasn’t filled with
tragedy this morning. They went through
their recitations in a mazed sort of way, momentarily
expecting the sword of Damocles to
fall. The worst trial came when they found
themselves before Doctor Webster reciting
Latin or Greek. They studied his face anxiously,
striving to surmise in what depth of disgrace
he held them. But nothing was to be
learned in that way. The principal treated them
the same as the rest of the class. Sandy decided
that their fate had already been decreed and
that the Doctor was only awaiting the end of
the session to acquaint them with it. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
session dragged to its close, twelve o’clock
struck, the corridor bell clanged and school was
dismissed; and still there had come no summons.
They scurried back to West House in
a group, discussing the marvel excitedly.</p>

<p>“Either they didn’t see us, after all,” said
Hoop, “or else they haven’t told the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it <em>was</em> a ghost,” said Spud.
“That’s the only sensible explanation, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I knew all along it was,” hazarded Claire
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Sandy, however, was not to be cheered.
“You wait,” he said gloomily. “It’ll come
this afternoon. Horace is just keeping us
guessing on purpose. I could see by his face
that he knew all about it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he doesn’t,” said Spud stoutly.
“I’ll bet we won’t hear anything more about
it. Hang those old apples, anyway! I only ate
one last night and it gave me a beast of a
tummy-ache. I had to get up and wander
around the room for hours.”</p>

<p>“That was your uneasy conscience,”
laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, you had one too, then. What were
you doing up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t up,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“Then it was Cal. It looked like you,
though.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t up either,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s lying. I saw one of you roaming
around in your room. My door was open
and so was yours and one of you passed the
window and went over in front of Ned’s bureau.
I whispered across to you but you didn’t
answer.”</p>

<p>“You dreamed it,” laughed Ned. “I’ll bet
you weren’t up yourself; you just had the
nightmare.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you run away and play,” said Spud.
“I guess I know when I’m asleep and when
I’m awake. I won’t say I didn’t have the nightmare,
though, but that was afterwards; after
my tummy had stopped aching and I’d gone
back to bed.”</p>

<p>“I dreamed most all night, I cal—guess,”
said Cal. “Awful dreams, too, they were.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts?” asked The Fungus.</p>

<p>“N-no, robbers, I think. It seemed that the
house was full of them and I was trying to
throw them out of the room as fast as they
came in, only they were too many for me.”</p>

<p>“Did you eat an apple too?” asked Spud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner was more cheerful than breakfast had
been until, in the midst of it, Mrs. Linn remarked:</p>

<p>“I had a call this morning from Miss Matilda
Curtis.”</p>

<p>Everyone stopped eating suddenly and
glanced apprehensively about him. Finally
Sandy inquired carelessly:</p>

<p>“Wh-what did she want, Marm?”</p>

<p>“She came about her apples,” answered
Mrs. Linn, and paused there to pour out a cup
of tea. Deep and oppressive silence greeted
this intelligence. It was Spud who caused a
diversion finally by choking and having to be
thumped on the back by Claire. Mrs. Linn
handed the cup of tea to Hoop to be passed and
continued.</p>

<p>“Yes, she wanted to know if I couldn’t use
some of them. She says it’s a wonderful year
for apples and they’ve got more than they
know what to do with. I told her I’d be very
glad of some for jelly. You boys all like apple
jelly, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” The reply was loud and enthusiastic.
Gloom gave way to relief and joy and
eight appetites reappeared as suddenly as they
had departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee,” said Spud afterwards on the porch,
“I thought it was all up then for sure!”</p>

<p>“Me too,” responded Hoop. “That was
the narrowest escape I ever did have. Say,
it was an apple that Adam and Eve got into
trouble about, wasn’t it? They must be wicked
things. I never did like them much. Anyone
can have mine that wants them.”</p>

<p>But there were no takers.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Afternoon school passed as uneventfully
as the morning session and no summons
from Doctor Webster reached the culprits.
Each of them drew a deep sigh of relief
when he was safely outside the front door of
School Building; and he didn’t linger long
thereabouts, but hurried off to the gymnasium
to prepare for football practice.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” Spud demanded
triumphantly as they went. “Horace hasn’t
heard a word of it.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” said Dutch. “Only
what I’d like to know is who was that in the
orchard last night?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we really did see anything,
after all,” mused The Fungus.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” replied Dutch.</p>

<p>But there was a chorus of protest from the
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“You bet we saw something!” cried Hoop.
“I saw it all right, anyway!”</p>

<p>“And so did I,” said Cal and Sandy in unison.</p>

<p>“Well, whoever it was,” declared Ned, “it
couldn’t have been one of the Old Maids, for
they’d certainly have scorched the ground getting
to Horace with their troubles. I’m beginning
to think that Clara is right and that it
really was a ghost.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any such thing,” jeered Spud
as they entered the gymnasium. “And, anyhow,
a ghost wouldn’t have swiped Cal’s pillow-case!”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it was or whoever it was,”
said Sandy earnestly, “I’m glad it didn’t give
us away.”</p>

<p>Practice that afternoon was strenuous and
Cal, having accepted philosophically the fact
that there was no escape for him, set to work
and made up his mind to master the intricacies
of the game. Not that it appeared much like
a game to him, however. He spent a quarter
of an hour handling the ball with others of the
“awkward squad”; passing it, catching it,
falling on it—when it was there!—and learning
not a few of its idiosyncrasies. He discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
for instance, that, contrary to his first
impression, it was sometimes possible to tell
which way the pigskin would bounce when it
struck the ground. At first if a ball was
dropped and he reached in one direction for
it it was nominally certain to bound off at an
opposite tangent. But after awhile he began
to develop a certain sense of prophecy, as it
were, and more often than not the ball came
toward him rather than away from him. They
put him with six other fellows in a line and
he was informed that he was to play left tackle.
For awhile that meant being shoved and
knocked around in order that an apparently
crazy boy with the pigskin clasped firmly to his
bosom might spring from behind him somewhere
and dash forward, only to deposit the
ball on the turf again and repeat the performance.
Cal was still appearing in his every-day
clothes, since the orchard episode had quite put
the thought of purchasing football togs out of
his mind. But Ned recalled it to him on the
way back to West House after practice and
showers.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make that trip to the village
tomorrow, Cal,” he announced. “We’ll get
Marm to let us have dinner early. Just about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
one more day and those trousers of yours
won’t be fit to wear to anything except a dog-fight.”</p>

<p>Cal examined them ruefully. They <em>did</em> show
signs of the fray, and that was a fact. The
knees bulged horribly and there was a nice collection
of yellowish mud around the bottoms
of them. He sighed.</p>

<p>“All right,” he answered. “I cal’late
you’re right, Ned. Maybe, though, I could just
get trousers now and let the other things go
until I get some money from home. Then I
won’t have to borrow from you, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, what’s the difference? You might
as well get the whole outfit now. Four dollars
will about do the trick and I can loan you two
just as well as not.”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you,” said Cal. “I just
thought—you see I ain’t ever borrowed any
money before and I don’t believe my mother
would like it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just until you get your own
money,” replied Ned carelessly. “There’s no
harm in that. Borrowing’s all right when you
can pay back. All the fellows borrow. Spud
owes fifty cents right now. I must remind him
of it when he gets his next letter. Spud’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
little bit forgetful, you see. I’ll give you the
money when we get to the Den.”</p>

<p>But Dutch Zoller challenged him to a set of
tennis as soon as they got around the corner
of the house and Ned forgot the money for the
time being.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’ll do, Dutch,” said Ned.
“I’ll play you and Cal.”</p>

<p>Dutch viewed Cal dubiously.</p>

<p>“But he doesn’t play, does he?”</p>

<p>“No, but neither do you, Dutch; not much,
that is,” replied Ned meanly. “You see, I’ll
beat you in either case.”</p>

<p>“You could give me thirty on a game,”
Dutch suggested. “That would make it more
interesting for you.”</p>

<p>“Thirty! Well, I like your nerve! Look
here, if you don’t want to play that way I’ll
take Cal with me and you play against the two
of us.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not,” Cal protested. “I don’t
know anything about it, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Time you did, then. And you’ll never find
a softer proposition to learn on than Dutch.
Come on! Get somebody’s racket from the
closet under the stairs. It doesn’t make any
difference whose racket you take; they’ll all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
kick about it. But you’d better take the best
you can find!”</p>

<p>In the end Cal was persuaded. He secretly
wanted to learn the game and not always have
to sit on the end of the porch and look on. Of
course his was a funny performance and when
the rest of West House arrived they had a fine
time watching his efforts and cheering him on
to victory. At first Cal was all for giving up,
but Ned told him to “buck up and not be an
idiot.” “They’re only fooling,” he said.
“You’ve got to learn to take a joke, Cal, or
you’ll have a pretty miserable time here, old
man.” So Cal thought better of it, gripped
his racket until his knuckles were white and
blisters began to appear inside his hands and
tried his best to profit by Ned’s shouted instructions.</p>

<p>“Let her go, Cal! Out here, Dutch....
Forty-thirty.... Hit it, Cal! Oh, say, don’t
dodge out of the way, but bat the stuffing
out of it! Hit <em>at</em> it, anyway, Cal! All
right; you’ll get on to it.... Deuce!
Play!”</p>

<p>Even with such a severe handicap as Cal’s
partnership Ned was always able to keep the
game in hand, for he didn’t hesitate to invade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Cal’s side of the court and take every ball that
he could possibly reach. And on Ned’s service
Dutch was nearly helpless. Toward the end of
the set Cal began to see the humor of his wild
slashes and awkward prancing and joined his
laughter with that of the gallery. Once when
he aimed a reckless blow at a low lob and accidentally
hit it so that it sped back across the
net and hit the ground just where Dutch
couldn’t get it the applause from the onlookers
was so tumultuous and hearty that Cal was
quite proud and made up his mind then and
there that he would learn tennis if he had to
die for it.</p>

<p>“Our set,” announced Ned. “Six—four.
Want to try again, Dutch?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll give me fifteen,” said Dutch.</p>

<p>But Cal declined to play any more. He was
very tired and quite out of breath, and, besides,
he knew that if he withdrew the others would
make up a set of doubles. So he took his place
on the porch and watched Ned and Hoop try
conclusions with Sandy and Dutch and got not
a few points in that way. Before the snow
came Cal had learned the game. He never
made a remarkable player, but he was able to
beat both Dutch and The Fungus, and Ned had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
only to give him a handicap of fifteen to ensure
a hard-fought match.</p>

<p>Ned and Hoop secured the first set, six—four,
and were one game to the good on the
second when supper time arrived.</p>

<p>“We’ll finish after grub,” said Sandy, “if
it’s light enough. We’ve got them on the run,
Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Hear the blatant boaster, Hoop,” said
Ned. “Bet you, Sandy, you don’t get one
more game in the set. Why, we’ve just been
trifling with you so far, haven’t we, Hoop?”</p>

<p>“Trifling is the word,” responded Hoop
gravely. “We have been merely amusing ourselves,
Sandy.”</p>

<p>Sandy laughed with much sarcasm and Dutch
emitted a word that sounded like “Yah!” and
whatever it was expressed ridicule and defiance.
How the second set came out Cal never
learned, for at the supper table Mrs. Linn interposed.</p>

<p>“Miss Matilda said she had two baskets of
apples for me if I’d send for them,” she announced.
“And I was wondering whether two
of you boys would go over for them after supper.
I guess they aren’t very heavy.”</p>

<p>Apples and the Misses Curtis being just then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
dangerous topics, there was a prolonged hush
about the table. The boys wondered if it would
be safe to present their countenances at the
Curtis front door. If the mysterious person in
white had failed to recognize them last night
might she not do so if she saw them again?
They cast doubtful and inquiring glances at
each other.</p>

<p>“Of course,” began Marm, “if you’d rather
not—”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” protested Sandy gallantly.
“We were just waiting modestly for you to
say who you’d rather have, Marm. I’d love
to go, only I’ve got a set of tennis to finish with
Ned and Hoop and Dutch. But there’s Spud
and The Fungus and Cal.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, Marm,” said Spud.</p>

<p>“So will I,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Bet you there won’t be many apples left
by the time they get back,” said Hoop.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess there’ll be plenty,” said Mrs.
Linn. “So you can all have some when they
come. I do think it’s kind of them to let me
have so many.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they?” asked Spud.
“Gee, they’ve got barrels and barrels of them,
haven’t they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but they sell most of them, I think,”
replied Marm.</p>

<p>“Sell them! Why, I thought they had money
to throw away.”</p>

<p>“They’re very rich, of course,” Mrs. Linn
replied, “but I suppose they think they might
as well turn the apples into money as have them
rot on the ground. They’re beautiful apples,
too.”</p>

<p>“They are indeed,” muttered The Fungus
dreamily. “<em>Ouch!</em>”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you ninny!” commanded Sandy
fiercely. The Fungus reached down and surreptitiously
rubbed his shin. Mrs. Linn looked
down the table wonderingly until Claire caused
a diversion by asking if they might have some
of the apples baked.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” said Spud gloomily.
“We’ll have ’em baked, all right; and stewed,
and made into apple pies and apple pudding
and all kinds of things. I hate apples.”</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Marm. “I thought you
loved them.”</p>

<p>Spud shook his head soberly. “No, ma’am,
not since they caused all that trouble in the
Garden of Eden. I used to be quite fond of
them before that, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Spud, you’re an idiot,” laughed Ned. “I,
for one, vote for baked apples, and lots of
them.”</p>

<p>“Seconded,” cried Sandy. “Likewise apple
pie.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have the pie without the bakes,” suggested
Dutch. “I can always eat pie.”</p>

<p>“You can always eat anything,” replied
Sandy severely. “And you’re too fat already.
No pie for you, Dutch.”</p>

<p>When supper was over Cal and Spud started
for the apples. As they went out the gate Ned
called after them softly.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, change caps or something so
they won’t recognize you!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they will,” said Spud uneasily
as they went down the street toward the Curtis
gate. “I sort of wish they’d keep their old
apples to themselves, Cal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was either of the Miss
Curtises that we saw last night,” answered
Cal. “They wouldn’t be roaming around in
the orchard at that time of night.”</p>

<p>“N-no, but it must have been someone!
And who the dickens was it? Here we are.
Let’s sort of keep our faces hidden as much
as we can, Cal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>That wasn’t hard to do, for it was already
getting toward dusk, and when they stood on
the front porch and rang the door-bell they had
the light behind them. Footsteps sounded inside
and Spud pulled his cap down. “Look
innocent, Cal,” he whispered, “look innocent!”</p>

<p>Cal assumed what he fondly believed to be
an expression of lamb-like innocence but which
came nearer to being a look of utter idiocy, and
then the door was opened and the unexpected
apparition of a girl of about their own age confronted
them. The messengers, who had expected
to see one of the Old Maids, were so
surprised that for a moment neither of them
did anything but stare. Finally, though, it was
Spud who blurted:</p>

<p><a href="#i_p173">“Good evening. We—we came for the
apples.”</a></p>

<p>The young lady in the doorway seemed to
find this announcement distinctly amusing. She
smiled and then she laughed; and then, doubtless
observing the bewildered expressions on
the faces before her, she stopped laughing very
suddenly and said:</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to laugh, really.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Spud murmured “Much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
obliged” rather vaguely, and Cal, to whom
girls other than his sister Nan were novel and
perplexing creatures, showed a decided disposition
to retreat and leave negotiations in the
hands of his companion.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” asked the girl demurely.
“I’ll tell Aunt Matilda that you’re
here.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll wait outside,” answered
Spud. “We just came for the apples.”</p>

<p>“I know.” The extraordinary young lady
again showed evidences of amusement as she
turned away, and Spud was almost certain that
he heard her giggling as she retreated down
the hall. He turned to Cal with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with that kid?”
he asked. “Do we look funny, or—or what?
And who is she, anyway? I never saw any
girls around here before.”</p>

<p>But Cal didn’t know and wasn’t interested.
And then the girl came back again.</p>

<p>“Aunt says will you please go around to the
woodshed. You’ll find her there.”</p>

<p>Spud thanked her and they made their way
along the length of the old house to where a
tall, thin lady with a very severe countenance
was pushing open the woodshed doors.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174-<br />175]</a></span></p>

<p>“We came for the apples for Mrs. Linn,”
said Spud.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” said Miss Matilda, pointing
to two piled-up baskets standing just inside
the door. “You’d better set them both outside
so’s I can lock up again. And tell Mrs. Linn
I’d like the baskets back tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Spud and Cal moved the baskets outside.
The shed was dark, but light enough to show
that one end of it was almost filled with barrels
of apples ready for heading-up. Even if they
had not seen them the odor would have told
the story.</p>

<p>“If you want some to eat,” said Miss Matilda,
“there’s a bin in that corner over
there.”</p>

<p>“No’m, thank you,” said Spud. “We don’t
care for apples.”</p>

<p>Miss Matilda sniffed.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re the first West House boys I
ever heard tell of that didn’t, then,” she said.
“Likely, though, you don’t care for them unless
you can steal them.”</p>

<p>“They—they don’t agree with me,” said
Spud uneasily. “Take hold, Cal. We’ll be
back for the other one presently, ma’am.”
Spud was in a hurry to get away, and so was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Cal, and in a moment the first basket was well
on its way to West House.</p>

<p>“I cal’late she suspects us,” said Cal when
they were out of hearing. “Did you see the
way she looked at us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t care a rap how much she
<em>suspects</em> as long as she doesn’t <em>know</em>, and make
trouble for us.”</p>

<p>When they returned for the second basket
Miss Matilda had re-entered the house,
much to their relief. But as they went out
a voice spoke from the end of the front
porch.</p>

<p>“It’s easier to carry them that way, isn’t
it?” asked the girl. The words were spoken
quite gravely but there was laughter behind
them. Neither Spud nor Cal found any reply
to offer, but once inside their own gate Spud
turned to Cal with a frown.</p>

<p>“That girl knows something,” he said decisively.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it was she who—who—”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Spud disdainfully.
“A kid like that? Not likely. But I wonder
what she meant by saying it was easier to carry
them this way. Sounds as though she knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
something, don’t it?” And Cal had to agree
that it did.</p>

<p>Spud sought information of Mrs. Linn.</p>

<p>“Who is the kid they’ve got over there,
Marm?” he asked as they set the basket down
in a corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Kid?” said Mrs. Linn. “Oh, you mean
the little girl. Why, she’s a niece, Spud. Did
you see her? Miss Matilda was telling me
about her. She’s come to spend the winter
with them. She’s their brother’s child; Mr.
George Curtis’s, I mean. He’s gone abroad or
somewhere. What is she like, Spud?”</p>

<p>“She’s a fresh kid,” answered Spud,
“and silly. She’s pretty, though, isn’t she,
Cal?”</p>

<p>But Cal didn’t appear to have any opinion
to express.</p>

<p>“Miss Matilda’s a haughty dame, isn’t she,
Marm? Asked us if we wanted some apples
and I said no, we didn’t care for them. And
she said ‘Hmph, guess you’re the first West
House boys that don’t. Probably you’d rather
steal them.’ What do you think of that, Marm?
Is that any way for a lady to speak to a gentleman?
Two gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Well now, Spud, you know you boys have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
made a good deal of trouble for Miss Matilda.
She’s sort of sharp, I’ll say that, but she’s
a real nice lady.”</p>

<p>“She offended me deeply,” said Spud.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you boys didn’t do it this
year,” said Marm.</p>

<p>“Didn’t do what?” asked Spud, selecting
an apple from a basket and setting his teeth
in it.</p>

<p>“Why, go over there and—and trouble her
apples.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, that is nice,” answered Spud,
winking across at Cal. “You need never be
afraid of anything like that happening, though,
Marm, while you have me in the house to—er—preserve
order.”</p>

<p>“You run along, Spud Halladay,” laughed
Mrs. Linn. “<em>You</em> preserve order! You’re
worse than any of them.”</p>

<p>“Study!” yelled Sandy from upstairs.</p>

<p>“Sandy has a very disagreeable voice at
times,” muttered Spud as he led the way out,
“and this is one of the times.”</p>

<p>It was not until Cal had entered the Den and
closed the door behind him that his eyes lighted
on his roommate. Ned was standing in front
of an open bureau drawer with a brown leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
collar-box in his hand and a look of consternation
on his face.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Cal, “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Ned hesitated a moment. Then he replaced
some collars in the box, put it back in the
drawer and closed the drawer.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” he answered finally.
“Only someone—only my eight dollars is
gone.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE MISSING MONEY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Gone!” exclaimed Cal. “Do you
mean—”</p>

<p>“I mean it was in my collar-box a couple
of days ago and now it isn’t,” replied Ned
with a shrug of his shoulders. “Somebody’s
cleaned me out for fair.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m awfully sorry,” faltered Cal.
“Are you sure it was there? Maybe you put
it somewhere else, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Maybe a fish can fly,” answered Ned
wrathfully. “I guess I know where I put it,
Cal. I always keep it there. There was eight
dollars exactly, a five and three ones, all folded
up in a wad. It was there two days ago all
right.”</p>

<p>“But—but who could have taken it?”
asked Cal perplexedly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” muttered
Ned savagely. “If I knew, I’d wring his neck
for him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you looked all through the drawer?”</p>

<p>“No. What’s the use? I tell you I <em>know</em>
it was in the collar-box.”</p>

<p>“Still, you might have pulled it out, maybe,
when you got a collar. I’d look if I were you,
Ned.”</p>

<p>So Ned, grumbling, looked, pulling the contents
of the top drawer out and then treating
the other drawers in the same manner. Afterwards
he searched about the table and went
through his trunk, and then, Cal egging him
on, searched the pockets of his clothes. But
the hunt ended fruitlessly save for a forgotten
five-cent piece exhumed from the depths of a
trousers pocket. This Ned threw across the
room peevishly and Cal rescued it from under
a bed and laid it sympathetically on the table.
Ned, hands in pockets, watched him in scowling
silence. Then,</p>

<p>“Don’t you want that too?” he exploded.</p>

<p>Cal looked at him in perplexity, missing the
innuendo.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked.</p>

<p>Ned turned away, already regretting his
question.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he muttered. He pulled his
chair out and seated himself at the table, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his books toward him. <a href="#i_p183">“Well, it’s gone,”
he said.</a> “That’s pretty plain. Guess we’d
better be thinking of studying.”</p>

<p>Cal took his place across the table but felt
very little like studying. Eight dollars seemed
a whole lot of money to Cal and I think the
loss troubled him more than it did Ned. He
opened his French book, but his mind, instead
of applying itself to verbs, concerned itself
with the problem of the missing money. Who,
he wondered, could have taken it? And had it
really been stolen or had Ned himself spent
it and forgotten all about the circumstances?
Or had Ned, in spite of his thorough search,
put it somewhere else than in the collar-box?
If it had been stolen suspicion must attach
itself to some member of the household. That
any of the fellows would do such a thing was
quite out of the question. Quite as plainly,
Marm was above suspicion. That left only
Hulda, the maid. Hulda had been there at
West House, Cal had heard, for several years,
and surely she would never have kept her place
had she not been honest. No, the theory of
theft was hardly plausible, he decided. Ned
<em>must</em> have spent or mislaid the money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_182">“Well, it’s gone,” said Ned</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184-<br />185]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced up and surprised Ned observing
him across the study table, and although Ned’s
eyes dropped quickly back to his open book Cal
had time to read the message in them. A little
shiver passed up his spine and he felt the blood
rushing into his face. He dropped his own
gaze, feeling suddenly very miserable and
lonely. It was plain enough now. Ned suspected
him of stealing the money! He recalled
Ned’s strange question: “Don’t you want that
too?” and now he understood. He felt terribly
hurt and wounded, for he had grown fond
of his chum, and that Ned could suspect him
of anything so mean and despicable was like
a blow in the face. But he did suspect him;
that was too evident. For a moment Cal
wanted to spring up and declare his innocence.
Surely Ned would believe him! But the tears
were very near his eyes just then and so he
stared at his book and sat silent.</p>

<p>Presently indignation began to take possession
of him. What right had Ned to suspect
him of being a thief? Just because he was poor
and didn’t wear good clothes like the other
fellows was no reason to think him a robber!
He was just as decent as the rest of them, in
spite of his shabby clothes! Ned thought him
a thief, did he? Well, he might go on thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
so for all Cal cared. Some day the money
would be found, like as not, and then Ned would
see what a mistake he had made. And when
he did he could beg Cal’s pardon until he was
black in the face, and Cal would never forgive
him! Never! He was all hurt pride now, and
the first and softer misery had left him. Let
Ned—yes, and all the rest of them—think
what they liked! They were all snobs anyway!</p>

<p>Cal learned very little of his lessons that
evening, nor, I fancy, did Ned do much better.
They were both glad when Sandy’s door
banged open and he gave the signal to lay books
aside. Almost simultaneously Spud demanded
admittance.</p>

<p>“Say, Cal, can you get that algebra?” he
asked as he came in and seated himself on Cal’s
bed. “It’s the hardest old stuff I ever did
see. What’s the matter with you chaps, anyway?”
he went on, sitting up and staring at
them. “Anybody dead?”</p>

<p>“Nothing’s the matter,” answered Ned
shortly.</p>

<p>“Ned’s lost some money out of his bureau
drawer,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“<em>Lost</em> it! How could you lose it? How
much was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eight dollars,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Phew! That’s some money, isn’t it? How
did you lose it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“How the dickens do I know?” asked Ned
grumpily. “All I know is that it was there a
couple of days ago and now it’s gone.”</p>

<p>Hoop and Dutch had walked in meanwhile
and for their benefit the tale of Ned’s loss had
to be retold. In a minute or two the whole of
West House was in possession of the news and
the eight boys sat around the Den and speculated
as to the manner of the money’s disappearance.
Cal was rather silent. Since Ned
suspected him, he thought, the others would
too. As a matter of fact, none of them did, but
he didn’t know that. It seemed to him that
every careless glance in his direction held accusation.</p>

<p>“Who knew it was there?” asked Sandy,
unconsciously trying to look like the pictures
of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>“No one except me.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Didn’t you tell anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” lied Ned. “I didn’t even
mention it to Cal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, Ned,” contradicted the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
quietly. “You told me yesterday about it.
Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Did I?” murmured Ned with a scowl.</p>

<p>“Yes, because you were going to lend me
two dollars so’s I could get my football things
and not have to wait for money from home.”</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten,” answered Ned carelessly.
But his glance at Cal said “Fool!” as plainly
as any words could have done. Cal hardly
knew what had prompted him to tell that. He
was angry with Ned for suspecting him and,
while appreciating the latter’s efforts to keep
others from doing the same, he told himself
that he would accept no favors. Hoop chuckled.</p>

<p>“Better give it back, Cal,” he advised.</p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed Spud, “maybe the fellow
I saw standing at your bureau last night
was the thief! Remember my telling you that
I saw someone in here and whispered across
and got no answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but burglars don’t wear pajamas,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he wore pajamas. I’m almost
certain that he had on a nightgown. Anyway,
he was in white. And he was standing right
there at that bureau.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was he doing?” asked The Fungus.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t pay special attention.
I just whispered across ‘O you Old Ned.’
And he didn’t seem to hear me and I went on
trotting about the room hugging my tummy-ache.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose you robbed yourself, do
you, Ned?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Besides, I told Spud before
that I wasn’t up last night once.”</p>

<p>“It must have been you, then, Cal,” said
Dutch with a grin. “You wear a nightgown,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Cal answered seriously, “but I
wasn’t up either. I cal—I guess Spud imagined
it.”</p>

<p>“Imagined nothing!” said Spud indignantly.
“I guess I know what I see!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was the ghost again,” said Claire
Parker in awed tones. The boys looked at him
and then at each other. Dutch laughed, but
it wasn’t a very hearty laugh. Finally,</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it was, fellows?” asked
Spud a trifle nervously.</p>

<p>“Oh, poppycock!” exclaimed Ned. “Ghosts
don’t swipe money out of bureau drawers. Besides—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides they couldn’t spend it if they had
it,” said Dutch. “Just the same I think it’s
sort of funny about that thing we saw in the
apple orchard; and then Spud seeing something
in white in here just a little while after
and—and—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Cal,” interrupted Hoop, “you
said you dreamed of robbers last night, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it seemed to be robbers.”</p>

<p>“There you are then! Robbers it was! Or,
at least, a robber. There was one in the house,
don’t you see, and although Cal didn’t get
wide awake his consciousness warned him of
danger and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows make me tired,” said Ned
peevishly. “Forget about the money. I guess
I can get some more somewhere.” He turned
to Cal. “Sorry I can’t lend you that two,
though, Cal,” he said constrainedly. “You
see I’m wiped out.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter, thanks,” replied Cal.
“I cal’late I’ll have to get some money from
home.”</p>

<p>They discussed the affair for half an hour
longer, Spud and Dutch advancing ingenious
theories to connect the mysterious visitant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the orchard with the midnight marauder in the
Den. Claire—or Clara, as we ought to call
him to conform to custom—sat enthralled and
timorous. Claire was only thirteen, we must
remember, had been brought up on fairy stories
and was far from being convinced that ghosts
were all moonshine. Presently Spud recalled
the girl that he and Cal had seen that evening
next door and told about her and her cryptic
remark when they were carrying the apples
home.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Spud, “that that kid knows
more than she’s telling.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose she—was the ghost,
do you?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“No, she’s just a kid. She wouldn’t think
of a thing like that. Besides, she was probably
abed and asleep at that time of night. But I’ll
bet she’s heard something.”</p>

<p>“We’ll appoint you a committee, Spud, to
take her a box of candy once a week so she’ll
keep mum,” said The Fungus.</p>

<p>“Yes, make it caramels,” suggested Hoop,
“and she can’t talk even if she wants to.”</p>

<p>“How old is she?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Spud carelessly.
“About as old as—as a girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really? You surprise me!”</p>

<p>“Well, how old do <em>you</em> think, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know either,” Cal replied. “I’ve
got a sister who’s thirteen and I cal’late this
girl’s about the same size.”</p>

<p>“I guess she wouldn’t know enough to make
any trouble,” said Sandy. “Well, I’m off to
bed. Hope you find your money, Ned. If you
want a little meanwhile I can let you have some,
I guess.”</p>

<p>The others said good night too and the Den
emptied. Cal closed the door and he and Ned
gathered their books together. Finally,</p>

<p>“I—I’m right sorry about that money,”
said Cal stiffly.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Ned. “It doesn’t
matter.”</p>

<p>After that they undressed in silence and went
to bed.</p>

<p class="cap">Such a strange thing had happened! One
of the brand-new pillow-cases was missing!
This was Saturday morning and Hulda had
been changing the bedding. Marm announced
her loss at the breakfast table. Hulda wasn’t
certain whose pillow the slip had been missing
from, but she thought it was Mr. Brent’s.</p>

<p>“I can’t think where it has got to,” lamented
Marm. “You don’t know where it is,
do you, Ned?”</p>

<p>Ned observed her frankly and gravely.</p>

<p>“I do not,” he replied. “And I don’t believe
it was mine. At least, I had both last
night.”</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, then it must have been lost
this morning. Perhaps Hulda dropped it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I hope she didn’t drop it on the stairs,”
said Spud anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” asked Marm.</p>

<p>“I might slip on it,” was the sober reply.
Marm wondered why the fellows laughed
and had to have the joke explained to her by
Hoop.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” The Fungus began, “the same
person swiped the pillow-case that took Ned’s
eight—”</p>

<p>But he stopped there, pretending to choke on
a mouthful of baked potato. It had been agreed
last evening that there was no use in troubling
Marm about Ned’s loss.</p>

<p>“Fungus,” said Sandy in his blandest tones,
“do you realize that you sometimes talk too
much?”</p>

<p>“At least,” defended Dutch with a chuckle,
“he knows when to shut up!”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Ned to Sandy when they left
the table, “that I’m just as curious as Marm
is about where that pillow-case has got to.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” replied Sandy, “never mind
about that. What bothers me is that money of
yours. That’s a very funny thing, Ned. Nothing
like it has ever happened in West House
since I’ve been here. You don’t suppose—”
he hesitated—“you don’t think that Cal
knows anything about it, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cal? Of course not,” replied Ned emphatically.
“I’d trust him anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, he doesn’t seem that sort to me,
either,” said Sandy. “I like the chap. Only
he did know the money was there, and then
Spud is certain that he saw someone in front
of your bureau; someone who wore a nightgown.
And excepting Cal and Clara the rest
of us all wear pajamas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot,” said Ned. “Spud was half
asleep, probably. Anyway, it’s a fair guess he
couldn’t tell whether the person wore a nightgown
or a—a potato sack. I’ll bet he imagined
the whole thing; dreamed it, probably.
I wouldn’t be surprised if I came across the
money somewhere, after all,” he added carelessly.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you do. I’d hate to think that
there was any fellow here who would steal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was stolen, Sandy.”</p>

<p>“But you said last night—”</p>

<p>“I know, but I’ve been thinking it over. I’m
pretty careless with things, you know. I dare
say I stuck it somewhere and forgot about it.
We won’t say anything more about it, especially
outside the house.”</p>

<p>“Not likely!” said Sandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Being Saturday there was no school. Ned
had said something two or three days before
about walking to Indian Head this morning
and Cal had eagerly agreed to accompany him.
Indian Head was a favorite resort with those
who liked walking and lay five miles away
across country. In Revolutionary times a
block-house had stood there and had been the
scene of an Indian massacre. Even yet relics
were sometimes found and almost every fellow
was the proud possessor of an arrow head purporting
to have been dug up on the site of the
old fort. Most of them had been purchased
from the enterprising merchant who sold post-cards
and curiosities in a little log-cabin at the
foot of the hill and looked suspiciously new.
Since the affair of last night Cal expected that
the excursion would be dropped. But Ned
sought him out after breakfast and reminded
him in an off-hand way that he had agreed
to go.</p>

<p>“Hoop and The Fungus are going, too,” he
said. “We’re going to start in about ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Cal after a moment of
hesitation. But when he had thought it over
he changed his mind. His grievance against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Ned still held good, and, he decided, he didn’t
want to go walking with a fellow who secretly
believed him a thief. So he told Ned he cal’lated
he wouldn’t go. And Ned said “Very
well” quite indifferently and the three went
off about half-past nine. Cal watched them
from his window and felt some regret. It was
a wonderful morning and he loved to walk.</p>

<p>When he went downstairs the house was
deserted, the rest of the inhabitants having
taken themselves off toward school. Cal put
his hands in his pocket and considered. It was
too fine a day to stay indoors. He cal’lated
he’d better follow the others over to the field
and see what was going on. Perhaps there’d
be a ball game, for base-ball at Oak Park was
played until snow came. Then his eyes fell on
the tennis court and he went in and found a
racket and for a half-hour amused himself
knocking balls across the net. After that he
wandered to the gate and through it and started
down the road past the Curtis place in the general
direction of town with a half-formed idea
of working back to the field by way of the cross
road, which would mean a two mile stroll. But
he wasn’t destined to get his walk this morning,
for when he came in sight of the carriage gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
beyond the white farm house he saw that the
nearer post was occupied. On it, swinging her
feet and munching an apple, sat the girl they
had seen last evening. Cal didn’t know very
much about the usages of society and wondered
whether he ought to take off his cap to the
young lady or speak to her. She was already
aware of his approach and it wouldn’t look well
to turn back, although he would have much preferred
that solution of his quandary. He cal’lated
he’d just say “Good morning,” and not
bother about his cap. But the matter was decided
for him.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said the girl. “Want an apple?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” answered Cal. He still had
several yards to go before he would be up to
her and he searched for something further to
say; it was too late now for the “Good morning”
he had contemplated.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like apples?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I ain’t hungry.” He was up to
her now and past and he breathed easier.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p199">“These are Ghost apples,” said the girl.</a>
Cal stopped and turned.</p>

<p>“They’re wha-what?” he stammered. The
girl put her head back and laughed merrily.
Then,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

  <img src="images/i_p199.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_198">“These are ghost apples,” said the girl</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200-<br />201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ghost apples,” she repeated. “They come
in pillow-cases.”</p>

<p>She smiled mischievously down at his
alarmed and puzzled face. Cal glanced apprehensively
toward the house.</p>

<p>“What do you know about pillow-cases?”
he blurted.</p>

<p>“Lots! Want to know what I know?” Cal
nodded.</p>

<p>“Pillow-cases,” said the girl, “are used to
cover pillows so that they won’t get soiled.”
She paused and looked at him with dancing
eyes. Cal grunted.</p>

<p>“What else?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“They are also used to—to gather apples
in.”</p>

<p>“Look here, did you see us—I mean <em>them</em>—I
mean—”</p>

<p>She nodded gayly.</p>

<p>“You and them both,” she laughed.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“John Boland,” answered Cal. Then he
added, thinking that perhaps it was the correct
thing to do: “What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Molly Elizabeth Curtis.” She made a
little backward movement with her head.
“They’re my aunts, you know. I live in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
York when I’m at home but I’m going to be
here all winter. Isn’t that awful?”</p>

<p>“Why, aren’t they good to you?”</p>

<p>“Of course they are, silly. But I guess it’s
going to be very dull after New York. Still,
I’ve had a pretty good time so far; especially
the night before last.”</p>

<p>Cal had drawn near and now he stood and
frowned at the tormentful young person on the
gate post and strove to consider what course
to pursue. It was evident to him that the young
person wasn’t going to tell all she knew until
she was quite ready to. Spud, he reflected, had
called her “a fresh kid,” and he cal’lated Spud
was about right. Still, she looked nice and was
quite pretty, Cal decided, as girls went. She
was slender and had a very clear complexion,
with cheeks in which the color had a way of
coming and going just as though she was able
to turn it on or off at her convenience. Her
hair, worn in a braid that hung to her neck and
was caught up again with a blue satin ribbon,
was deeply brown and her eyes were brightly
blue. Not that Cal observed all these things at
this time, however. About all he thought was
that she was pretty for a girl and looked as
though she was too jolly and nice to willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
get anyone into trouble. As for her age, he
had guessed pretty near right, he told himself;
she was probably thirteen; not more than fourteen
at the most. Cal didn’t know much about
girls and was at a loss how to handle the present
situation. He was determined, however, to
get at the truth before he left there. So he
began by saying sternly:</p>

<p>“Look here, now, you’d better tell me what
you know about the other night.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Miss Molly Elizabeth Curtis,
arching her eyebrows and looking fearfully
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Because if you don’t—”</p>

<p>“Then what?” she asked as he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, you better had,” he ended lamely.
She laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Mister John Something,
that you’d better be nice to me instead of making
threats? Supposing—just supposing,
now—I was to show Aunt Matilda what I have
hidden in my trunk.”</p>

<p>“What—what is it?” asked Cal uneasily.
Molly leaned down and whispered dramatically:</p>

<p>“A pillow-case marked ‘West House’ in
black ink on the hem!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“You—you wouldn’t do that, though,” said
Cal, half questioningly. “You’re too nice a
girl.”</p>

<p>The nice girl put her head back and laughed
harder and merrier than ever, until Cal looked
again toward the house and wondered if Miss
Matilda could hear.</p>

<p>“You’re—you’re awfully funny,” she
gasped finally. “Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I cal’late so, maybe,” answered Cal, willing
to agree for the sake of diplomacy. “Is
that pillow-case in a good safe place, Miss?
You know if Miss Matilda got hold of it
she’d show it to our principal and he’d—
I don’t know what he’d do; suspend us,
likely.”</p>

<p>“She won’t ever see it,” replied Molly reassuringly.
“It’s in my trunk and my trunk’s
locked and here’s the key.” She tugged at a
little blue ribbon around her neck and drew
forth the key in proof. “I’m keeping it as a
trophy, you know. I mean the pillow-case. My,
but it was fun!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t you, was it?” cried Cal. Molly
nodded with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes. Want me to tell you all about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” answered Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beg my pardon for saying what you said,
then,” she commanded.</p>

<p>“What did I say?” muttered Cal.</p>

<p>“That I’d better tell you or—or something!
Don’t you know that you mustn’t threaten a
lady? Besides,” she added thoughtfully, “it
just makes them stubborner.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Cal grudgingly. “I won’t
do it again.”</p>

<p>“But go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead—what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Beg my pardon. You haven’t yet, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well—all right. I do.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t!” she exclaimed impatiently.
“You just stand there and say you
do and you don’t!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re mighty particular,”
he grumbled.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t want to know about it,
after all,” she said indifferently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, honest! I—I beg your pardon,
Miss.”</p>

<p>“Well, but please don’t call me Miss. I’m
only thirteen and you’re not a miss until you
have long dresses. Call me Molly. What do
they call you? Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Cal.”</p>

<p>“Cal? That’s a funny name. Is it your
middle name?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s just—just a—a nickname.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” She folded her hands in
her lap, having finished with her apple, and
considered her narrative. “Well, it all happened
like this,” she began after a moment.
“You see, there’s just me here and no one to
play with. Of course I don’t mind that so <em>very</em>
much because I like to read books and stories.
But it <em>would</em> be nicer if I knew somebody,
wouldn’t it? That’s what I told Aunt Lydia
and she said it was too bad I wasn’t going to
school because I’d meet lots of girls there.
You see, father doesn’t want me to go to school
this winter because I’m pretty well along anyhow
and then my eyes got bad last spring. I
told Aunt Lydia I guessed I’d like to know
some of the boys next door, but she just held
up her hands in horror. Did you know, Cal,
that you are awfully bad? Aunt Matilda says
so. She says you’re a—a— Oh, what was
it? A ‘parcel of young varmints,’ that’s it!”</p>

<p>Cal grinned and Molly smiled back at him.</p>

<p>“I guess Aunt Matilda doesn’t like boys
very well, though,” she continued extenuatingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
“Anyhow, she said I mustn’t think of
playing with any of you. But I used to hear
you across the hedge and one day I thought
I’d like to see what a ‘varmint’ looked like.
So I went over there and peeped through. You
were playing tennis, some of you, and some of
you were on the porch. And just then two—I
think you were one of them, Cal—came
over toward the hedge and I heard you talking.”</p>

<p>Cal grunted. The mystery was clearing up.</p>

<p>“I remember,” he said. “We were talking
about getting through the hedge.”</p>

<p>“And stealing—I mean helping yourself to
the apples.”</p>

<p>“I guess stealing’s the word,” he said with
a smile.</p>

<p>“The other boy saw me or heard me or something,
don’t you remember? I got down on the
grass and hid until you’d gone. Then I thought
what fun it would be to surprise you. I didn’t
want to tell because—oh, because I should
think it would be rather fun to steal apples.
Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It wasn’t very much fun the
other night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it was—for me!” cried Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—we thought you were a ghost,” said
Cal a trifle shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“I meant you to!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see, though, how you did it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. It was a—an inspiration, I
guess! You see, I didn’t mind you taking all
the apples you wanted, because there are just
bushels and bushels of them and my aunts
would never miss them a tiny bit, but I did
want to have some fun. At first I thought I’d
wait for you at the hedge and threaten to tell
if you didn’t take me along with you. But I
didn’t know any of you, you see. Then I just
decided that I’d have fun my own way. So I
got a sheet out of the linen-closet and a broom
from the kitchen. I did that before supper and
hid them under the bed in my room. What
made it very difficult was that they insist on
my going to bed every night at half-past nine.
At home I <em>always</em> stay up until ten. So I had
to go to bed as usual, though, of course, I didn’t
really take all my clothes off. Aunt Lydia
always puts her head in my door and says good
night to me. That’s my room on the side. See
the two windows over the porch? That’s how
I got out. I was afraid to go downstairs because
my aunts would be certain sure to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
me. So after Aunt Lydia said good night I
crept out of bed and dropped the broom and
the sheet out of the window. Then I came
down after them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you did it,” said Cal with
a trace of admiration. “You didn’t jump, did
you?”</p>

<p>“No, there’s a rain-spout on the other side;
you can’t see it from here. I got down by that
and I got back the same way. It isn’t hard at
all. You stand on the porch rail and then you
put one foot on the thing that holds the spout
up and the other on top of the dining-room
window, and then you can get your knee over
the edge of the roof and you’re all right. I
made sure I could do it before supper, though.
After I got down I took the sheet and the broom
to the wagon-shed back there and got ready.
I waited and waited and thought you weren’t
coming after all. Then I could see you moving
down by the hedge. So I crept out and went
around through the blackberry patch until I
was at the edge of the orchard. But you were
all so busy you wouldn’t have seen me, anyway.
When you did see me, though, it was
just too funny for anything!”</p>

<p>Molly laughed merrily at the memory of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and Cal said “Huh!” in a disgusted tone and
looked bored.</p>

<p>“It was a silly trick to play,” he said severely.</p>

<p>“Because you were fooled,” responded
Molly serenely. “I guess I must have looked
pretty—pretty ghastly! Anyway, you all
yelled like anything and just ran! I <em>was</em> glad
you got your apples, though. I suppose you
were all too scared to drop them!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get mine,” said Cal grimly.
“Mine were under the tree.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s your pillow-case I found!” exclaimed
Molly, clapping her hands gleefully.
Cal nodded. Then he grinned.</p>

<p>“I was up in the tree,” he said. Molly
frowned.</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“After—the others left.”</p>

<p>“You never were!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was. And you came right underneath
and I was—well, I was pretty frightened.”
Molly giggled. “You’d have been,
too,” he added defensively.</p>

<p>“Of course I would,” she owned. “I guess
I’d have fallen right out of the tree. I wish,
though, I’d known you were up there, Cal,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
she went on regretfully. “I’d have stayed
there, I guess. Did you see me dancing?”</p>

<p>“Was that what you were doing? I couldn’t
see very well on account of the leaves, but sometimes
you looked about ten feet tall and sometimes
you weren’t any higher than that.” Cal
put his hand a couple of feet from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“It was the broom made me look tall. And
I guess when I wasn’t any higher than that I
was stooping down emptying the apples out
of that pillow-case. I do wish I’d known you
were up there, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t,” said Cal with a
laugh. “It was bad enough as it was. What
did you dance for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just—just for fun,” answered Molly
vaguely. “It was a Dance of Triumph.”</p>

<p>“Where did you go to? It seemed to me you
just—just vanished.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that was because I took the sheet
off. I had a dark dress on.” She smiled reminiscently.
“It was lots and lots of fun,
Cal.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was for you,” he grumbled.
“We didn’t think it was very funny. We
thought it was a ghost for sure. I cal’late the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
fellows will be glad to find out what it really
was. Spud said last night he was pretty sure
you knew something about it.”</p>

<p>“Was he the boy who came with you for
the apples?” Cal nodded. “Do you think
they’ll be very—very angry with me?” she
asked. “It was just a joke, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I cal’late not,” answered Cal. Molly
gave a little shriek of triumph.</p>

<p>“Now I know why they call you Cal!” she
exclaimed. “It’s because you’re always saying
‘cal’late.’”</p>

<p>Cal reddened. “That’s why,” he confessed.
“They make a lot of fun of me. I don’t see
why cal’late ain’t just as good a word as—as
any other.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it hasn’t the sanction of usage,”
replied Molly glibly. Cal blinked.</p>

<p>“I cal’late—I mean I guess that’s it,” he
murmured. Molly laughed.</p>

<p>“You said it again, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Cal, “I’m trying to get
out of it, but I keep forgetting.” There was
a moment’s pause, and then, “Mrs. Linn
missed her pillow-case this morning,” he announced
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Did she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I cal—I guess if I had it I could
get it back and she wouldn’t know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you could—if you had it,”
agreed Molly.</p>

<p>Cal eyed her askance.</p>

<p>“You might give it back to me, I think.”
But Molly shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, it’s—it’s spoils of war. Besides, I
shall keep it and make you all do just what I
want.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Cal uneasily. “What—sort
of things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t decided yet. Not fully, that
is. There’s one thing you must do, though. I
want to learn to play tennis. I guess one of
you can teach me that. And I want to see a
football game.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Cal gloomily. Then, brightening
up, “But your aunts won’t let you have
anything to do with us,” he said hopefully.</p>

<p>“But they will after awhile,” answered the
young lady with a slight toss of her head.
“You—you’re the wedge.”</p>

<p>“The what?” gasped Cal.</p>

<p>“The wedge, the entering wedge. Aunt
Lydia has been watching us out of the sewing-room
window for a long time, and she will tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Aunt Matilda and Aunt Matilda will scold.
Then I shall tell her what a nice, polite boy
you are and that you invited me to play tennis
with you—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” cried Cal indignantly.</p>

<p>“But you’re going to,” returned Molly
calmly.</p>

<p>“I’m not either! I—I don’t play tennis.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You’ll take me over some
day and one of the other boys will show me
how.”</p>

<p>“I guess girls aren’t allowed at West
House,” said Cal desperately.</p>

<p>“Oh, fiddle! You don’t guess anything of
the sort.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, I won’t have anything to
do with it,” declared Cal with decision. Molly
looked regretful.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said, “because I’m so
afraid Aunt Matilda will make trouble when
she sees that pillow-case.”</p>

<p>“You—you wouldn’t show it to her!” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to,” she answered gently,
with a shake of her head.</p>

<p>Cal considered a minute. Finally,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered ungraciously,
“I’ll see about it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she murmured. “And you
do want me to play tennis with you, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’ve got to,” he replied. Then
the humor of it reached him and he chuckled.
“You’re a pretty smart girl, you are,” he said
in grudging admiration. Molly accepted the
tribute gravely, but there was a glint of laughter
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’ve got <em>some</em> sense,” she replied
demurely.</p>

<p>Cal flushed. “If you make fun of me I won’t
do it,” he declared aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to make fun of you, truly,”
she assured him contritely. “And—and I
think ‘cal’late’ is a very nice word. I guess
you’d better go now, though, because Aunt
Matilda’s coming.”</p>

<p>“Where?” he asked in alarm. Molly
nodded down the road.</p>

<p>“In the buggy. She’s been to the village.
Oh, you needn’t run, because she’s
seen you already. But if you just walk
off you’ll get away before she can say anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“But—but she’ll scold you, won’t she?”
he asked, pausing indecisively in flight.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t mind. Besides, she doesn’t
really <em>scold</em>; she just ‘expostulates for my own
good.’ Good-by. Come to the hole in the
hedge this afternoon at half-past five and I’ll
tell you when I can play tennis with you. Don’t
forget!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” called Cal, hurrying toward
home and safety.</p>

<p>“You <em>do</em> want me to play tennis, don’t
you?” she called after him.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” he shouted back. Then he
plunged through West House gate with a deep
sigh of relief.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ned and Hoop and The Fungus came back
in time for dinner rather tired of body but
undismayed of spirit. They brought a new
assortment of “genuine” arrowheads and
many highly colored post-cards. And The Fungus
had purchased a photograph frame fashioned
of wood with views of Indian Head on it.
This, he stated, he meant to give to someone
at Christmas. He was rather vague as to the
identity of the future recipient and Spud got
alarmed and announced carelessly that personally
he didn’t care for Christmas presents.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s a perfectly good photograph
frame, Fungus, and all that. And it looks quite
expensive, too. I suppose you had to give as
much as five cents for it.”</p>

<p>“You run away and play,” answered The
Fungus indignantly. “It cost fifty cents,
didn’t it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Really?” exclaimed Spud. “I don’t see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
how they can sell them for that!” An ambiguous
remark that caused The Fungus much
speculation.</p>

<p>The trio were full of their trip and took turns
narrating their adventures during dinner until
at last Sandy voiced the sentiment of the rest
of the company.</p>

<p>“Write it out, Hoop,” he said wearily,
“and send it to Copenhagen. You talk so
much about it I don’t believe you ever got to
Indian Head.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, don’t give it all to us now,
Hoop,” said Dutch. “Keep it and deliver a
lecture in the Town Hall. I thought you were
going along, Cal.”</p>

<p>“I was, but—I changed my mind. I cal’late
my discoveries are more important than
theirs,” he added meaningly.</p>

<p>“Discoveries?” asked Sandy. “What
about?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Something I mustn’t hear,” said Mrs.
Linn good-naturedly. “I suppose you’ve been
in mischief.”</p>

<p>“What I admire about you, Marm,” said
Sandy with a laugh, “is your—your—what’s
the word, Ned; acumen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Marm never wears one,” said Spud
gravely.</p>

<p>On the porch later Cal told them what he
had learned that morning from Miss Molly
Elizabeth Curtis. Sandy was inclined to be
severe with the young lady, but the rest, especially
Spud, thought it was an excellent
joke.</p>

<p>“She must be a smart kid,” Spud asserted.
“And plucky, too. Think of her climbing down
a water-spout!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a water-spout, it was a rain-spout,”
corrected Dutch.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Lots. Rain-spouts are on houses and
water-spouts are in Captain Marryat’s stories.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Dutch, “I don’t like
her having that pillow-case. Won’t she hand
it over, Cal?”</p>

<p>“No, she won’t. She says she’s—she’s
going to—to hold it over us.”</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Sandy, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, keep it and make us do what she
wants.”</p>

<p>“Well, what—do you—think—of that?”
gasped The Fungus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Someone ought to box her ears!” declared
Sandy indignantly.</p>

<p>“You might suggest it to Miss Matilda,”
laughed Spud. “I think she needs it myself.
Just the same, she’s a smart kid!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she would tell on us,” hazarded
Clara anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she wouldn’t,” agreed Cal.
“Still, I cal—I guess we’d better be sort of
decent to her.”</p>

<p>“But what does she want?” asked Sandy
frowningly.</p>

<p>“Well, she wants to learn to play tennis, for
one thing,” Cal replied. “And she says she
wants to see a football game.”</p>

<p>“Wants to come over here and play tennis?”
gasped Hoop. “She certainly has
nerve! Who’s going to teach her, Cal,
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I told her I didn’t play. I guess it’s
up to you, Hoop.”</p>

<p>The others laughed, but Hoop waxed wroth.
“I guess I see myself teaching a girl to play
tennis!” he said. “If she comes over here
once she’ll be always tagging around. Girls
are beastly bothers.”</p>

<p>“But you’re just as much in it as we are,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
said Spud gravely. “And if she wants
you to teach her I guess you’d better,
Hoop.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say anything about me,” cried
Hoop. “She doesn’t know me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but she wants to, probably. She admires
your manly beauty, Hoop. I move that
Hoop be appointed to teach her tennis. All
in favor will so signify.”</p>

<p>“Aye!” The vote was unanimous.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” growled Hoop. “I don’t
play well enough, anyway. Sandy or Ned
ought to teach her if anybody’s got to.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put on the finishing touches, after
you’ve taught her the rudiments,” said Ned
kindly. “As to football, why, I guess that’s
where Clara comes in. As he doesn’t play he
will make a nice guide for the girl. All in
favor—”</p>

<p>“Aye!”</p>

<p>Clara looked worried but said nothing.</p>

<p>“She’s as pretty as a picture, Clara,” said
Spud. “Wish I were you!”</p>

<p>“You can take my place if you want to,”
said Clara eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you see I have to play,” Spud
answered hurriedly, while the others laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
“Is there—is there any other little thing we
can do for her, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of—yet. I cal’late she’ll
think of something, though,” he added gloomily.</p>

<p>“It’s perfect nonsense,” declared Sandy,
“but I don’t see what else we can do. We’ll
just have to—to humor her and get on the
right side of her until she gives up that old
pillow-case.”</p>

<p>“Even if she did,” said Dutch, “she could
tell on us any time she got mad.”</p>

<p>“Let her! She wouldn’t have any proof
then. Ned, you’re a diplomat. Suppose you
make it your life’s work to recover that silly
old pillow-case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Me for the diplomatic service.
When do we get a look at this lady friend
of yours, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You see her aunts don’t
want her to have anything to do with us, and
maybe—”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted The Fungus. “That’s
our only hope, fellows. Let’s go over and
break a few windows so Miss Matilda will hate
us worse than ever.”</p>

<p>“Or we might write an anonymous letter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her telling how depraved we all are,” suggested
Spud.</p>

<p>“She says we’re varmints,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Did she say that?” demanded Spud.
“Now I <em>will</em> bust a window for her.” And he
took up a tennis racket and made as though to
hurl it over the hedge in the direction of the
Curtis house.</p>

<p>“Honest to goodness, fellows, there’s
something in that,” said Dutch thoughtfully.
“If we could only convince the Old Maids
that we are really desperate characters
it’s a sure thing that she wouldn’t let
that obnoxious kid come anywhere near
us.”</p>

<p>“But how shall we do it?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We’ll think it over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose the Obnoxious Kid—which
is a perfectly good name for her—gets
huffy because she can’t learn to play tennis
and see the football games and goes and shows
that pillow-case to the Old Maids?” asked
Sandy.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” answered Spud, “that
she would do it anyway. I’ll bet she wouldn’t
want them to know that she’d shinned down a
water—I mean rain-spout any more than we’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
want them to know that we’d been over helping
ourselves to their apples.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Sandy. “I hadn’t
thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t think too much of it now,”
said The Fungus dryly. “That girl is the original
trouble maker and I’ll bet she’d go to
prison if she could get us into a fix. Girls are
always making trouble, anyway. The best
thing we can do is to keep her away at any cost.
I think we ought to do something awful and see
that the Old Maids hear about it.”</p>

<p>“Let us hear from the Diplomatist,” suggested
Sandy.</p>

<p>“The Diplomatist agrees,” answered Ned.
“Let’s think up some scheme for making ourselves
thoroughly disliked over there. Then
they’ll keep Miss Molly away from us and we
won’t be troubled with her. I know what girls
are. They’re always wanting you to do things
for them. She’d be an awful bother, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Of course she would,” Hoop agreed with
enthusiasm, thinking of the tennis lessons.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to think up something,”
said Sandy. “Meanwhile I guess it’s pretty
near time to wander over to the field. I think
they might cut out practice this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“When’s the first game?” asked Hoop.</p>

<p>“Two weeks from today. We haven’t got
a show this year, fellows.” Sandy as usual
was sadly pessimistic.</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” said The Fungus. “We’ll
wipe the gridiron up with the Hall. You wait
and see!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll wait all right, and I’ll see,” answered
Sandy gloomily. “I’ve seen before.
The trouble with the House Team is that it
never has any team-play.”</p>

<p>“You’re a croaker,” said Spud disgustedly.
“Come on over, fellows, and let’s get busy.
Gee, I’d work Saturdays and every other old
day if it meant a win over Hall this year!”</p>

<p>They trooped off through the park together
half an hour later. Clara, although he couldn’t
play on the House Team and had not attempted
to get a place on one of the Junior elevens, was
an enthusiastic partisan and followed practice
faithfully every day. At three o’clock the two
gridirons were sprinkled with players, House
and Hall working diligently in preparation for
the coming battles. Brooks, or Brooksie as he
was called, was captain of the House Team.
He was a tall, well-built fellow of seventeen,
an excellent leader and a good player. At practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
he was somewhat of a martinet and, as
Spud said once, could get more work out of a
fellow than a slave-driver. This afternoon
drill was harder and longer than usual. Cal
did his best, but before practice was half over
had decided that he would never make a football
player. Something that added to his discouragement
was a calling-down by Brooks.</p>

<p>“I say, Boland,” said Brooks, “this isn’t
an afternoon tea, you know. Don’t you come
out here again dressed like that. Why haven’t
you got your togs on? Too lazy to change,
were you?”</p>

<p>He didn’t wait for an answer, but darted
away to lecture a back who was dropping too
many punts. Cal looked after him mutinously
and made up his mind then and there that was
positively his last appearance on the football
field. He was mistaken, but he didn’t know
it.</p>

<p>He had to skimp his shower-bath in order
to get back to West House in time to keep his
appointment at the hedge at half-past five. He
didn’t particularly want to keep it, but he was
afraid not to. When he thought what might
happen if Doctor Webster learned of the raid
on the apple orchard he was ready and willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to do most anything to placate the Obnoxious
Kid. She was there waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said. “I’m afraid you’re
late.”</p>

<p>She had squirmed through the lilac hedge
and was leaning against the picket fence in full
view of West House. Cal wished she had kept
out of sight. He didn’t exactly know why he
objected to being seen there in conversation
with her, but he did object and showed it by
his restlessness and evident desire to be gone.
Molly, observing this, prolonged matters dreadfully.</p>

<p>“Have you been playing football?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Cal briefly.</p>

<p>“It must be fun to be a boy.” Molly sighed
enviously. “Did you tell the others about
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did they say?” she asked anxiously.
“Were they angry?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly. Sandy was sort of
mad.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Sandy?”</p>

<p>“He’s House Leader. His name is Fred
Sanderson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I like him. Do you all have
nicknames?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s Sandy and The Fungus and
Dutch and Hoop and Spud and—and Clara.
Ned Brent—he’s my roommate—hasn’t any
name except Ned.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’ll let me call them by
their nicknames?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“I—I suppose so. Did you—ask your
aunt about letting you come over?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She wanted to know who I was talking
to and I told her it was one of the boys
who came for the apples. I said you were very
well-behaved and polite and that you wanted
me to play tennis with you.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“She said,” Molly replied cheerfully, “that
I couldn’t do anything of the sort!” Cal
heaved a sigh of relief and Molly frowned.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s very nice of you to look
so—so pleased about it!”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t. It’s too bad, isn’t it? But
I cal’late she knows what is best for you.”</p>

<p>“You’re just glad,” said Molly unhappily.
“And after I went and said such nice things
about you, too!” Cal’s conscience smote him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m awfully much obliged,” he muttered.
“Perhaps she’ll change her mind.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure she will,” responded Molly.
Cal’s face fell again. “She says I may talk
to you when I meet you, and that’s more than
I thought she would let me do. That’s nice,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Awfully,” murmured Cal, striving his best
to look properly appreciative. “Only I cal’late
we aren’t likely to meet very often.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will. I’m often outdoors. All
you’ve got to do is to whistle when you want
to see me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll let you know how I’m getting
along. Aunt Lydia doesn’t think you boys are
very bad and I’m sure she will be on my side.”</p>

<p>“Well, I—I’ve got to be going,” said Cal.
“I hope it will be all right.”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Linn nice?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“Bully,” Cal said.</p>

<p>“Aunt Lydia said she was,” said Molly
thoughtfully. “Well, good night. I’ll see you
tomorrow maybe.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe so,” Cal stammered.
“Tomorrow’s Sunday and we go to church in
the morning—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, if you don’t want to!” exclaimed
Molly with a toss of her head. “That’s different.
<a href="#i_p231">You’re a very horrid, rude boy, Cal</a>,
and—and perhaps Aunt Matilda is quite
right!”</p>

<p>She turned and pushed her way through the
hedge and out of sight. Cal looked after her,
wavering between an impulse to call her back
and apologize and a sensation of vast relief.
After a moment he turned away whistling and
went into the house. He was sorry he had
offended her, for she was a real nice girl, after
all, but perhaps it was just as well, for if she
remained angry with him she probably wouldn’t
bother them any more. When the others came
back he said nothing of having seen Molly and
hoped that Marm hadn’t observed him talking
to her across the fence. If she had she made
no allusion to it.</p>

<p>Being Saturday night there was no study
required and the boys were free to do as they
pleased. It pleased them to remain out of
doors until it was quite dark, for the evening
was warm for the time of year. There was a
tennis foursome that ended in a battle, with
tennis balls for missiles, involving the entire
company. Afterwards they went indoors and
had music. Cal was called on to sing and give
his entire repertoire, Ned playing his accompaniments.
After they had “Yo-heave-ho’d”
to their hearts’ content they went upstairs and
ended the evening with a grand pillow-fight,
Den and Sun Parlor versus Ice Chest and
Smellery, that lasted with unabated vigor until
Marm requested a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>Cal and Ned got on together without embarrassment
as long as there were others about,
but as soon as they were alone they found
nothing to say and the coolness was very apparent.
Tonight, as they were destined to do
on many nights in the future, they undressed
and got to bed without the exchange of more
than a dozen words.</p>

<small>CAL MUTINIES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Monday Cal mutinied. When the time
came for football practice he was on his
way through the park to West House. It was
a dull, gloomy afternoon and the house was
silent and lonesome. Resolutely he set his
books out on the table and studied. It was hard
work at first, but presently he got interested
and long before the others returned he had prepared
his lessons for the morrow. There was
a general demand to know why he had not
shown up at practice and Cal merely replied
that he hadn’t felt like football today.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t envy you explaining to
Brooksie tomorrow,” said Sandy with some
severity. “But that’s your affair.”</p>

<p>Cal didn’t exactly envy himself that task,
but to be able that evening to sit at ease and
read a bully story about hunting and trapping
in Canada while Ned and all the others had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
study almost made up for any trouble to come.
It evidently didn’t occur to Ned that his roommate
had studied in the afternoon and he shot
many a puzzled look across the table but asked
no questions. Affairs between them had by
now progressed to a stage where they never
spoke to each other unless a third person was
present.</p>

<p>The notice board in School Building served
as a sort of morning newspaper and few fellows
went to class without pausing to read the
messages scrawled there. The next morning
Cal stopped as usual and found for the first
time a message for him.</p>

<p>“Boland. Meet me after morning. Brooks.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late,” he mused as he tore the slip
down and replaced the thumb-tack in the corner
of the board, “that means trouble. But
he can’t <em>make</em> me play football if I don’t want
to!”</p>

<p>He awaited Brooks on the steps after school.
The House captain came out with Will M’Crae,
quarter-back on the House Team, but excused
himself when he saw Cal.</p>

<p>“What was the matter yesterday, Boland?”
he began with a frown. “Why didn’t you
show up at practice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve decided not to play football,” answered
Cal calmly.</p>

<p>Brooksie stared.</p>

<p>“You—you’ve <em>what</em>?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided not to play any more,” Cal
repeated less assuredly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have?” said the captain sarcastically.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think I’m cut out for the
game, for one thing. It’s pretty hard work,
too.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Brooks, “you’re doing
fine. What else?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything to wear.”</p>

<p>“They sell football togs in the village,”
suggested the other with ominous calm.</p>

<p>“I can’t afford to get them.”</p>

<p>“You can’t? Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t the money.”</p>

<p>A couple of smaller boys had paused near-by
and Brooks, seeing them, took Cal’s arm and
drew him down the steps and a little way along
the East House path.</p>

<p>“Look here, Boland, is that straight?” he
asked. “Can’t you afford three or four dollars
for football togs?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, Brooks. I oughtn’t to. I—we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
ain’t got much money, you see.” Brooks
observed him, frowning intently. At last he
concluded that Cal was speaking the truth and
not merely exaggerating his poverty in order
to escape practice.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” he said. “You come
with me.”</p>

<p>Wondering what was going to befall him
now, Cal accompanied the other across the
bridge and along the path to East House. He
had never been there before. East House was
newer than West and larger. It accommodated
fourteen fellows to West House’s eight. On
the square porch Cal paused but Brooks beckoned
him in and led the way up the stairs and
into a nicely furnished room on the second floor.
There were lots of pictures on the walls, a good
deal of comfortable mission furniture with
leather upholstery, and several Oriental rugs
on the hardwood floor. Altogether the room
was a revelation to Cal of what a school study
might be if the occupant possessed both money
and good taste.</p>

<p>“Sit down, won’t you?” said Brooks, pushing
a deep-seated chair forward. Cal seated
himself, placed his cloth cap over one knee and
smoothed it down there, feeling somewhat embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and ill at ease. Brooks went to a
closet and in a moment was back with an armful
of togs.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he said, dumping the things
in Cal’s lap. “Shirt, breeches and stockings.
I haven’t any boots, but I guess you can use
what you’ve got for awhile. These things
aren’t new by any means, but I guess they’ll
last the season out. You can get Mrs. Linn to
patch that place in the jersey.”</p>

<p>“But—but I oughtn’t to take these,” stammered
Cal.</p>

<p>“Yes, you ought. Now look here, Boland. I
don’t want to be nasty, but honestly you
haven’t any business to act like this. You’re
a new boy, and I guess that explains it, though.
At that, Boland, you’ve been here long enough
to know things. Haven’t they told you that we
don’t shirk duty here at Oak Park? I suppose
it’s Sanderson that’s at fault; he’s a good deal
of a duffer, to my mind. Tell him so if you
want to. It’s a shame you West Housers
haven’t got another chap for Leader over
there.”</p>

<p>“Sandy’s all right,” said Cal with a scowl.
Brooks smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you’ve got that far,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
said. “At least you’ve learned to stand
up for your House. But hasn’t Sandy told
you that every fellow is expected to take
hold and work for his House? That with
us it’s House first, School next and self nowhere?”</p>

<p>“Ned Brent said something like that,” answered
Cal.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ned would. Why don’t you do as
Ned does, then? You want House to win, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Cal indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you help us then instead
of sulking? What if football practice is hard?
I know it well enough. I’ve been all through
the—the drudgery, just as you are going. It
isn’t any harder for us than it is for Hall,
though. It isn’t any harder for you than it is
for any other new boy. And after you’ve
learned you’ll get a whole lot of pleasure out
of it.”</p>

<p>“But it don’t seem to me,” muttered Cal,
“that I ever can learn. I cal’late I’m no good
at football.”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your business,” said Frank
Brooks sharply. “That’s my look-out. If I
didn’t think you could be useful to the team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
do you suppose I’d waste my time on you for
a minute?”</p>

<p>This hadn’t occurred to Cal and he digested
it a moment. Then,</p>

<p>“You mean that you think I can learn to
play the game?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I mean that I think you can be of use
to the House Team. That’s enough. If you
can be of use it’s your duty to work hard
and forget yourself, Boland. Get that
idea?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Brooks observed him a moment.
Then he smiled and thumped him on his
back. “You’ll do, Boland. No more nonsense,
though, <em>if</em> you please. See you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Cal bundled the togs up.</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I can,” he said simply,
“but—”</p>

<p>“But nothing,” laughed Brooks. “You do
what you’re told to do as well as you know
how and leave the ‘buts’ to me. Glad you
came over, Boland. You’ll get on all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t just like to take these things,
though,” Cal objected.</p>

<p>“Piffle! They’re no use to me. Call it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
loan if you like. You can hand them back after
the season’s through—if there’s anything left
of them! Good bye.”</p>

<p>So ended Cal’s mutiny.</p>

<p>Half-way through the park <a href="#i_p243">he stopped and
examined the contents of the bundle</a>. There
was a very fair pair of khaki breeches, properly
padded on hip and knee, a somewhat
threadbare cherry-red jersey with a three-corner
tear on one sleeve and what seemed to be
a brand-new pair of red stockings. He felt
very proud of these new possessions, very
proud, too, that Brooks had assured him that
in spite of his own misgivings he was really
of some use to the team. He made up his mind
to buckle down and do the best that was in him,
even if, at the end, he was destined to be only
an onlooker when the battles raged. And without
intentional disrespect to Sandy, he heartily
wished that Frank Brooks was leader at West
House.</p>

<p>A fairly uneventful week followed. He
neither heard nor saw anything more of Miss
Molly Elizabeth Curtis and he and the rest of
the House forgot their misgivings. They
talked of her once or twice during the first
few days and then, as she didn’t obtrude herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
thought no more about her. Football
practice went on six days in the week. They
were hard at signal work now, and Cal, playing
tackle on the second eleven, had grown interested
in his duties. The first game was only
a week away and already the air was surcharged
with excitement. House boys began to
sport their cherry-red and Hall fellows their
blue. Football became the subject for conversation
at every meal and Mrs. Linn, as was her
yearly custom, displayed a well-meaning but
frightfully ignorant interest in the game. Lessons
suffered proportionally as football fever
increased and the instructors, notably Mr. Kendall,
familiarly known as Grouch, railed and
scolded. Only Mr. Fordyce, who taught English
and physics, and who was called Fussy,
took it philosophically, apparently realizing
that in a month or so affairs would be back on
their accustomed plane and no one the worse.
For once Fussy belied his title. Mr. James, in
whose room Cal had his desk, might have been
expected to be more lenient with the fellows in
their football madness than anyone else, since
as physical instructor he had direct charge of
the players. But Jim, as he was called, drew
a hard and fast line between class-room and
playground and so far as he was concerned
athletic prowess was no excuse for lack of attention
to studies. Several of the boys found
this out during the last of October and the first
of November, and it was a dull week indeed
when someone was not absent from practice on
either Hall or House field because Jim believed
that a cessation of athletic industry would improve
class standing.</p>

<p>At West House football put Ned’s misfortune
out of everyone’s mind, excepting Ned’s
and Cal’s. The mystery remained unexplained,
but the generally accepted theory, introduced
by Ned himself, was that the money had been
mislaid and would sooner or later be discovered.
Cal appreciated his room-mate’s generosity in
seeking by every means to keep suspicion from
him, but he hadn’t forgiven Ned for himself
suspecting. The breach widened rather than
lessened as the days went by, and Cal wasn’t
very happy. Rooming with a chap to whom
you have nothing to say and who has nothing
to say to you is an uncomfortable business.
Neither Ned nor Cal knowingly gave any evidence
of the estrangement, but it didn’t take
the other boys long to discover it. At another
time it would have occasioned more interest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
just now football was the only topic holding
anyone’s attention.</p>

<p>On the Monday before the first game Frank
Brooks finished his experiments and the First
Team as it lined up that afternoon was the
team that would face the Hall, barring accidents.
West House had secured five places.
Sandy was at left guard, Dutch at left tackle,
Spud at left end, Ned at right half-back and
The Fungus at left half-back. That left six
places for East House. Brooks played right
guard. The quarter-back was Will M’Crae and
on him the Houses pinned much of their faith,
for besides being a good general he was an exceptionally
good punter. Hoop and Cal had
drawn places amongst the substitutes, Hoop as
a guard and Cal as a tackle. There had never
been much sympathy between these two, for
Hoop had a passion for saying mean things
without really wanting to hurt, and Cal had
not forgotten the incident attending his arrival
at West House when Hoop had tripped
him up on the steps. Dutch and Hoop got along
splendidly together as room-mates, for Dutch
was good-natured to a degree and paid very little
attention to his chum’s gibes. Most anyone
could have got on with Dutch Zoller. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
together in the substitute ranks, however,
brought Cal and Hoop together a good deal
and Cal soon got to liking the other very well
and it wasn’t long before he had ceased entertaining
any animosity toward Hoop for the little
incident on the steps. They walked back
to West House together that Monday afternoon
after practice was over and discussed
their chances of getting into the first game.
By this time Cal had cultivated quite a keen
interest in football and no one worked harder
or took his knocks more cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You’re likely to get in before I do,” said
Hoop. “Brooks is bound to play every game
through, while as for Sandy, although Truesdale
will play all around him, he’s no quitter.
But Griffin at right guard gets hurt easily.
When you do get in it will be to replace him,
Cal. Dutch doesn’t know how to get hurt, so
you needn’t look for his place.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we’re bound to get into one of
the games, aren’t we?” Cal asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. We may get into them all for awhile.
You can’t tell. Brooks <em>might</em> lay off part of
Saturday’s game so as to save himself up; he
would if the game went our way, I guess. Then
I’d get my whack at it. I’m crazy to get up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
against that duffer Williams of the Hall. He
always plays high and I’ll bet I can get right
through him.”</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’d be kind of scared if they did
put me in,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Rot! You wouldn’t either! You’d forget
all about being scared after the first play.
When the other chap is trying to pull you on
your nose or walk up your spine you haven’t
time to think whether you’re scared or not.
Gee, I’ll be sorry when the season’s over!”</p>

<p>“What do they do here in winter, Hoop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, play hockey a good deal. We had a
fine team last winter. I don’t play myself;
can’t skate worth a hang; never seemed to be
able to learn how. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I learned when I was about eight, I
guess. I’ve never played hockey, though. Is
it hard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. We play basket-ball, too. That’s
good fun. West House won the School Championship
last year; beat East House and First
and Second Hall. I played.”</p>

<p>“No wonder you won, then,” laughed Cal.
Hoop grinned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it that way,” he said.
“Sandy’s the bang-up basket-ball player. He’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a dandy center. And Ned’s a cracker-jack,
too. I guess you could make good at that if
you went in for it, Cal.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to try. I’ve seen them play it at
home.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lot of fun. Hello!”</p>

<p>They had walked over in advance of the
others and now, as they turned the corner of
the house, Hoop stopped still and stared. On
the top step sat a girl with a brand-new tennis
racket in her hands!</p>

<p>“Is that her?” growled Hoop in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Cal, “and it looks as
though she’d come to play tennis, Hoop.” He
grinned. “Maybe you can beg off, though;
tell her you’re too tired and—”</p>

<p>But Hoop had fled back around the corner.
Cal meditated following him, but at that moment
Molly turned her head and saw him.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she called. “I’ve been
waiting here the longest time!”</p>

<small>MOLLY TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“How do,” returned Cal, walking toward
her with unflattering deliberation. “I
thought you couldn’t come.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I feared you’d feel so bad
about it,” she laughed, “that I just <em>made</em> them
let me. Aren’t you terribly glad to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Cal without much enthusiasm.
“How—how did you manage?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just kept at it. Aunt Lydia was on
my side and she told Aunt Matilda that she
guessed you wouldn’t eat me if I was to come
over here. I’ve been calling on Mrs. Linn.
She’s a dear, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Er—yes.” He was looking at the racket
with strange fascination and Molly, following
his glance, smiled brightly and held it out for
his inspection.</p>

<p>“I bought it this morning. Is it a good
one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think so. I don’t know much about tennis
rackets. Ned can tell you. He will be here
in a moment; the others, too. Did you—do
you want to play today?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if it isn’t too late. I’ve been here a
long time, but I suppose you have all been playing
football.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we had a pretty stiff practice and I
cal’late we’re rather too tired to—”</p>

<p>But at this moment the others came around
the corner, Hoop, arm in arm with Sandy and
Spud, scowling ferociously and evincing a desire
to escape. If Cal expected evidences of
embarrassment on the part of the girl he was
disappointed. She only smiled interestedly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to introduce me, Cal,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>Cal had never done such a thing in his life,
but he managed to get through with the task
in some manner, Spud, claiming the privileges
of former acquaintance, helping him out.</p>

<p>“And this,” said Spud finally, “is Mr.
Hooper, who has eagerly volunteered to teach
you tennis, Miss—er—Curtis, while here in
the background, modest youth that he is, hides
Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker is our football guide
and wishes me to offer his services to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Hoop growled something under his breath
that didn’t sound especially flattering to Spud,
but Clara walked up and shook hands very
nicely. Molly bowed and said “How do you
do,” or shook hands and said “I’m very glad
to meet you” at each presentation, and the
boys, grinning, seated themselves on the steps
and frankly looked her over. She didn’t seem
very formidable with her pink cheeks and blue
eyes, and it was difficult to realize that she figuratively
held their welfare in the small hands
that gripped her tennis racket.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said to Sandy, “that Cal
has told you that I want awfully to learn to
play tennis? He said he didn’t play very well
but that he thought one of you would find time
to show me a little about it. Do you mind my
coming over here?”</p>

<p>Sandy proved traitor on the spot.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he declared heartily. “I
guess any of us will be glad to play with you.
I suppose it’s a bit dull over there with just the
Old—I mean with just your aunts.”</p>

<p>Spud snickered and Sandy frowned at him.</p>

<p>“Awfully,” agreed Molly. “I thought it
was very nice of Cal to want me to come over
here. And I’m glad you don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Hoop surreptitiously kicked Cal in the small
of the back.</p>

<p>“We don’t mind at all,” said Spud.
“We’re tickled. I guess there’s time for a
lesson now if you start right away. You’d better
get your racket and some balls, Hoop.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” muttered Hoop, casting mutinous
eyes around the group.</p>

<p>“Miss Molly understands that,” said Ned.
“She’ll forgive you if you’re not at your best,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>But Molly was viewing Hoop doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess he doesn’t want to,” she said, turning
to Sandy. “I’ll come some other time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a lesson myself,” declared
Sandy, jumping up. “Find my racket for me,
will you, Clara? And bring some balls out.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call him Clara?” asked Molly
as the boy hurried inside on his errand.</p>

<p>“Because his name’s Claire,” answered
Dutch.</p>

<p>“What a funny name for a boy! And what’s
yours?”</p>

<p>“Dutch.”</p>

<p>Molly laughed and went around the group,
nodding her head at each in turn.</p>

<p>“Spud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just Ned.”</p>

<p>“Sandy.”</p>

<p>“The Fungus.”</p>

<p>“Hooper.”</p>

<p>“He means Hoop.”</p>

<p>“And you are Cal,” she said, reaching that
youth.</p>

<p>“Short for Calamity,” explained Spud
gravely.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he quick?” sneered Hoop, still resentful.</p>

<p>“Quickest thing ever,” answered Spud affably.
“Lightning is cold molasses beside
me. That’s where I get my name, you
know,” he added, turning to Molly. “Ex-spud-itious.”</p>

<p>The boys groaned, but Molly laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said, “I’ll get you all
terribly mixed up at first, and I hope you won’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“We never mind,” declared Dutch quite flippantly
for him. He received his reward from
Molly in the shape of a smile and for some
time after secretly rather fancied himself as
a wit.</p>

<p>“My name,” she announced, “is Molly. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
guess you’d better call me that, if we are
going to be friends.”</p>

<p>Clara returned with the racket and she and
Sandy proceeded to the tennis court, the others
politely electing to watch from a distance so
as not to embarrass the novice.</p>

<p>“She’s a funny one,” observed The Fungus
with a grin. “‘If we are going to be friends,’
said she. She knows mighty well we don’t dare
be anything else!”</p>

<p>“She’s a good sort,” said Spud. “And I
guess we might as well make up our minds to
enjoying what they call female society after
this. Did you see Sandy fall for her on the
spot?”</p>

<p>“Conceited idiot!” growled Hoop. “I
hope he falls into the net and—and—”</p>

<p>“Chokes to death,” added Spud helpfully.
“Remarks of that sort from you, Hoop, are
sadly out of place. You are a—a renegade.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I didn’t agree to give her
tennis lessons.”</p>

<p>“Do I really have to take her to watch football?”
asked Clara.</p>

<p>“Of course you do,” Dutch said severely.
“Don’t you <em>want</em> to?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seems to me,” observed The Fungus,
“that our diplomat isn’t on to his job. Are
you—diplomating, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Diplomacy is brain-work.
I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why we gave the job to you,
then,” muttered Hoop. “What we ought to
do is to find where she keeps that pillow-case
and go over and nab it.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” Dutch grunted, “I’d like to see
anyone go prowling around where Miss Matilda
would catch him.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, what’s the good of bothering about
that old pillow-case?” asked Spud impatiently.
“She isn’t going to be mean. She’s just
having a little fun with us. Look at Sandy,
fellows; isn’t he having one grand good
time?”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p257">Sandy was toiling valiantly, chasing balls on
all sides of the court.</a> Molly’s efforts were
ludicrous and pathetic, and for a time she
couldn’t get it into her little head that there
was any method to the game beside batting the
balls back and forth. The supper bell brought
welcome relief to her instructor, although he
made believe that he simply hated the thought
of stopping.</p>

<p>“You did finely,” he declared as they returned
to the porch. “All you need is a few
more lessons.”</p>

<p>“That’s silly,” answered Molly promptly.
“I know very well that I was just as stupid
as stupid! I’m going to buy one of those little
blue books with the rules in them the first thing
in the morning. Then I’ll know what it’s all
about. Thank you very much for teaching me.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Sandy, and “Good
night,” called the others. And Molly, her
racket tucked under her arm, took her departure.
Sandy subsided on the top step and said
“Whew!” very expressively. The rest observed
him grinningly.</p>

<p>“How now, gallant squire of dames?” asked
Spud.</p>

<p>“Someone else has got to take her the next
time,” responded Sandy with decision. He
glanced at Hoop. But that youth was looking
the other way and whistling softly.</p>

<p>“Beautiful sunset, Hoop,” murmured Spud.
Hoop scowled.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you draw lots?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We will,” said Sandy, “after supper.”</p>

<p>They did. He and Spud arranged the slips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of paper and in some remarkable fashion the
fatal slip fell to Hoop’s portion.</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair!” he objected. “You fellows
faked!”</p>

<p>But they were very stern with him and in the
end he accepted the duty with ill grace. There
were three more lessons that week and Hoop
officiated at two of them, the other being given
by Spud. Strangely enough, Hoop, after the
first time, became interested in the task and
was quite loth to relinquish in Spud’s favor
when the third lesson was due. Clara’s duties
began on Wednesday. On that afternoon he
took Molly in charge and escorted her to the
football field, where she occasioned not a little
interest on the part of the candidates. It was
something new and novel to have a girl in the
audience at practice and I fancy some of the
boys worked harder than usual in the hope of
distinguishing themselves and so winning a
glance of approval from Miss Molly. Clara
was very patient and instructive. A few weeks
before he had had very little football knowledge
himself, but he had watched and studied
with enthusiasm and was now a very capable
instructor. Molly had never seen the game
played before, but, while she objected to it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
first as being much too rough, it wasn’t long
before she was an ardent champion of the House
Team. Clara lent her his rule book and she
studied it diligently during the next week.
Some of the questions she asked were a trifle
disconcerting; such as “Why don’t they have
the field smaller so they won’t have so far
to go to make a touchdown?” or “Would it
count anything if they threw the ball over that
bar instead of kicking it?” She listened
avidly to all the football discussions on the
steps of West House and declared on Friday
that if House didn’t beat Hall she’d never
speak to any of them again. That threat must
have nerved the House Team to desperation,
for on the next afternoon it battled valiantly
against Hall and managed to hold its opponent
scoreless through thirty-five of the forty minutes
of playing time, and had begun to count
on a tied game at least when a miserable fumble
by The Fungus on the Hall’s forty yard-line
turned the fortunes of the day. It was
Pete Grow himself who leaked through the
House line, gathered up the ball and, protected
by hastily formed interference, romped over
the line with it for the only score of the game.
They failed at goal and a few minutes later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
House trailed off the field vanquished to the
tune of 5—0.</p>

<p>House was heart-broken. To have kept Hall
at bay through thirty-five minutes of the fiercest
sort of battling and then to lose on a fluke
was the hardest sort of luck. The Fungus felt
the disgrace keenly and looked forlorn and
tragic enough to melt a heart of stone. After
the first miserable ten minutes succeeding the
game his team-mates set themselves generously
to work to cheer him up.</p>

<p>“Your fault nothing!” scoffed big, good-hearted
Westlake, the House center. “Why,
any one of us ought to have got that ball.
What if you did fumble it? Gee, we all do that.
The trouble was that the rest of us weren’t
quick enough to make it safe.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Ned sadly. “I ought
to have had it myself. That chap Pete Grow,
though, was through like a streak.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Dutch, “it’s up to me, when
you come right down to facts. I ought never
to have let Grow through.”</p>

<p>“Never mind whose fault it was,” said
Brooks cheerfully. “We’ve just got to get
busy this week and get together. It mustn’t
happen next time, fellows. We’ve got to develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
team-play in the next five days or they’ll
wipe up the sod with us. After all, we had
them at a standstill until that pesky fumble.”</p>

<p>Clara and Molly went back to West House
silent and sad. But by the time they had
reached the porch and Molly had established
herself in her accustomed place with her slim
back against a pillar the silence gave place to
regrets and discussion. Molly was inclined to
be indignant with the Hall.</p>

<p>“They oughtn’t to have taken advantage of
Fungus’s mistake,” she declared. “I don’t
think that was very—very sportsmanlike, do
you?”</p>

<p>But Clara pointed out to her that ethically
Hall had not transgressed. “Fumbling’s part
of the game,” he said, “and you’ve got to
take advantage of everything, Molly. We
played a pretty good game, after all, I think.”</p>

<p>“We played a wonderful game!” she assented
stoutly. “Why, we just put it all over
the Hall at first.” Clara smiled at the phrase
she used.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I guess we can do better the next
time. The trouble today was that we couldn’t
get near enough Hall’s goal to try a drop-kick
or placement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“How near would we have to get?” asked
Molly.</p>

<p>“Oh, about thirty yards, I guess. M’Crae’s
a dandy from the thirty yard-line.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Spud splendid?” she asked. “He
just threw those Hall men about like—like
straws!”</p>

<p>“Spud’s a dandy end,” Clara agreed. “He
played all around Smith. I do wish, though,
we might have won. Now we’ve got to get both
the other games.”</p>

<p>“And we will, too,” said Molly, her eyes
flashing. “You just wait and see!”</p>

<p>The others came dejectedly home and until
supper time they threshed out the day’s battle
over and over again, Molly taking a fair share
in the debate. The general tone was pessimistic,
but Molly refused to entertain the thought
of ultimate defeat for a moment.</p>

<p>“You’ve just <em>got</em> to win the next two
games,” she declared. “And you’re going to,
aren’t you, Sandy?” But she had selected
the wrong person in Sandy. He shook his head
discouragedly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” he answered. “They’ve
got team-play, Molly, and we play every man
for himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you and your team-play!” scoffed
Spud. “Why can’t we learn team-play as well
as they can? You wait until next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m through,” muttered The Fungus
miserably. “I guess Brooksie will put in Folsom
on Monday.”</p>

<p>“Folsom!” jeered Dutch. “Folsom can’t
begin to play your game; nor Westlake, either.
Don’t you be so sore, old man. You couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I could have helped it, only—well,
if Brooksie keeps me on I’ll bet it won’t
happen again. After this I’m going to dig my
nails into it!”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have explained to them that
you didn’t mean to drop that ball?” asked
Molly earnestly. “That it was just a—a mistake,
Fungus?”</p>

<p>The laughter that this question produced
cleared the atmosphere not a little and by the
time the bell had rung West House was a good
deal more cheerful and much hungrier.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she the limit?” laughed Spud as they
went in to the dining-room. “Asking if Fungus
couldn’t have explained that it was a mistake!”</p>

<p>“She’s a mighty nice kid,” said Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“She nearly yelled herself hoarse this afternoon,”
said Cal. “Did you see her, Hoop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and once she was jumping up and
down like an Indian. I guess she’s the most
enthusiastic rooter we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“The Obnoxious Kid,” murmured Spud.</p>

<p>“Obnoxious nothing!” objected Sandy indignantly.
“She’s all right!”</p>

<p>And West House agreed to a man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE PIPPIN CLUB IS FORMED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next afternoon, a warm Sunday, a
strange thing happened. West House in
full force filed out of the gate, along the road
and in through the entrance to the Curtis place.
The invitation had been delivered by Molly
after church at noon, with Miss Matilda standing
watchfully by and Miss Lydia beaming and
nodding over her shoulder. It was a momentous
event, for nothing of the sort had ever
happened before in the history of West House.
The boys had attired themselves in their Sunday
best and were a very meek and well-behaving
group as they mounted the porch and
rang the bell. Spud pretended to be the victim
of a vast and overwhelming terror and grasped
Sandy’s arm convulsively when they heard the
bell jangle inside.</p>

<p>“I would I were away,” he muttered. “Ah,
woe is me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>To their relief it was Molly herself, Molly
in a stiffly starched muslin dress, who opened
the door to them. They filed decorously in,
deposited their hats and caps on the marble
table in the hall and right-wheeled into the
parlor. There they seated themselves in a circle
about the room and felt very awkward and
uncomfortable. Molly did her best to set her
guests at ease, but the task was a difficult one.
The assemblage was like her dress, very stiff
and starchy. They discussed morning service,
the weather, Spud’s new necktie and the pictures
on the walls, and just when things did
seem to be thawing out the least little bit there
was the sound of footfalls on the stairs and
instantly the guests froze into immobility.</p>

<p>Entered Miss Matilda followed by Miss
Lydia. The guests arose as one man, painfully
polite and serious. Miss Matilda motioned
them back to their seats. Down they sat with
a unanimity that suggested previous rehearsals.
Miss Matilda announced that she was very
glad to see them, and Sandy murmured—well,
nobody ever knew what he murmured. But the
tone was quite correct and the murmur served
the purpose. Miss Lydia, plainly embarrassed,
smoothed her black silk gown over her knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and smiled. Conversation proceeded by fits
and starts. It went like a trolley car in a
crowded street. Just when they thought it was
nicely started, with a clear track ahead, it
stopped with a bump. Then, after a dismal
silence off it started once more with a jerk.
Miss Matilda, Molly, Sandy and Spud were the
principal conversationalists. Molly supplied
subjects, Miss Matilda frowned them aside,
Sandy rescued them and Spud babbled. Babbled
is the only word for Spud’s efforts. He
babbled of the weather and the dust in the
streets and Mrs. Linn’s tonsilitis—a mild attack
of no importance save as a subject for discourse—and
finally of Molly’s tennis. The
others looked on in evident and often open-mouthed
admiration and awe. Strangely
enough it was Spud’s last babble that cleared
the conversational track for several blocks, so
to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad she’s doing nicely at it,”
said Miss Matilda with a sniff, “though I don’t
see why she wants to learn it. In my day young
girls didn’t race around hitting rubber balls
with snowshoes.”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s a very pleasant game,” suggested
Spud, vastly encouraged by his success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
“and quite—er—popular nowadays,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Popular! I dare say; most anything that’s
silly enough is popular these days, it seems.
When I was a girl sewing and embroidery, yes,
and plain cooking, were popular.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t say but what this tennis may
be good for Molly. I guess most anything that
will keep her nose out of books for awhile will
be beneficial. And it’s very kind of you young
gentlemen to teach her the game.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Miss Curtis,” protested Sandy.</p>

<p>“I say it is,” responded Miss Matilda firmly.
“Boys don’t usually like to have girls about
them. I told Molly that when she first asked
me to let her go over to your house. She said
you were different.” Miss Matilda smiled
briefly. “Maybe you are. My experience with
boys makes me convinced that they’re all pretty
much alike. I haven’t anything especial against
them, though they most usually have dirty
shoes—” Eight pair of feet crept under eight
chairs—“and are noisy. And sometimes
they don’t pay much attention to the eighth
commandment.” Rapid glances were exchanged
between her hearers. Dutch was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
plainly striving to recall which commandment
was which. Miss Matilda arose in her majesty.
“Come, Lydia,” she said. Miss Lydia obeyed,
casting a final embarrassed smile over the circle.
At the door Miss Matilda paused. “I
hope you will come again,” she said quite graciously.
“It will be very pleasant for my
niece. We will be glad to see you any time
so long as you behave yourselves.”</p>

<p>Exit Miss Matilda and Miss Lydia.</p>

<p>Spud drew a long breath that seemed to come
from his shoes and glanced about him.</p>

<p>“Did anybody speak?” he inquired. Molly
giggled softly. The footsteps of the Misses
Curtis died away upstairs.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Sandy, looking around for
confirmation, “that we’ll have to be going back
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hoop and The Fungus in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, please!” exclaimed Molly. “Let’s go
out to the shed. It’s dandy out there; and
there are lots of apples.”</p>

<p>“Well—” began Sandy hesitatingly. But
Molly had already jumped up and was leading
the way. The boys seized their caps from the
table and followed her down the steps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
around the side of the house. At Molly’s command
the sliding door was pushed back and a
fervid aroma of apples met them.</p>

<p>“Now let’s bring some of those boxes over
here by the door,” she said, “and sit down.
Two of you can have the wheelbarrow.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p273">Presently they were all seated</a>, Spud and Cal
on an empty barrel which creaked ominously
whenever they stirred, but not before Molly
had led the way to the best apples and they
had supplied themselves therewith.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully fond of apples,” she announced
from her seat on a soap box by the
door. “Aren’t you?” She addressed Sandy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “and these are dandies;
aren’t they, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Great,” Ned agreed with gusto. “I don’t
believe we ever knew about these.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of deep silence. Then
Molly threw back her head with a peal of laughter
and the boys, looking silly and sheepish,
finally joined in. So far the incident of the
midnight adventure in the orchard had not
been mentioned between them. But now Spud
said:</p>

<p>“That was a great joke you played on us
that night, Molly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_p273">
  <img src="images/i_p273.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="" title="" />

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_272">Presently they were all seated</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274-<br />275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you awfully angry when Cal told
you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No. Only Sandy. He was sort of peeved.”</p>

<p>“I?” said Sandy in surprise. “Not at all.”
He frowned at Spud, but that irrepressible
young gentleman went on.</p>

<p>“I guess you didn’t know, Molly,” he said,
“that Ned was appointed a committee of one
to—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Spud!” growled Ned.</p>

<p>“To get that pillow-case back. Ned’s our
diplomat. Whenever he is extra nice to you
you must be very careful. That’s his diplomacy.
He’s after the pillow-case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid,” answered Molly.
“No one knows where it is, you see.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Spud. But Molly gave a
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell him, Cal! Don’t you dare!”</p>

<p>“I guess it wouldn’t do him much good if I
did,” said Cal. “He couldn’t get it.”</p>

<p>“N-no, I suppose not. Perhaps some day if
you’re all just awfully nice to me I’ll give it
back to you.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” said Ned. “How did
you fix yourself up that night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>So Molly recounted her adventures, and by
leaning forward they could see the rain-spout
that she had clambered up and down by. Viewing
it was, however, disastrous to Spud and
Cal, for an empty barrel set on its side is at
best an uncertain seat, and now when they both
leaned forward the barrel “took it into its
head,” as Spud explained, to lean backward,
with a readily imagined result. When they had
picked themselves up Ned tried to clap Spud’s
pun.</p>

<p>“The barrel,” he said, “was merely trying
to stave you off.”</p>

<p>“Hoop you choke,” responded Spud
promptly.</p>

<p>After which scintillations Molly went on
with her story.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Sandy, when she had finished,
“you have a perfect right to keep the
pillow-case, Molly—”</p>

<p>“Right of capture,” interpolated The Fungus.</p>

<p>“But if your aunts ever found it and told
Doctor Webster, we’d be in a bad mess. So
don’t you think you’d better—er—better—”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” laughed Molly. “And you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
don’t need to worry, Sandy, one bit. It’s in
a perfectly safe place, and locked up. And just
as long as you’re nice to me, and do everything
I want you to it will stay there!”</p>

<p>Spud groaned. “She has us in her power,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” Molly exulted laughingly.
“And I shall make you do anything I
want!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t want too much,” said Hoop.</p>

<p>“I hope,” inquired Spud concernedly, “that
our friend Mr. Hooper is properly attentive,
Molly? If he doesn’t do what you want him
to let us know and we’ll kill him. And Clara,
too. Is he quite satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Clara is perfectly dear,” answered Molly.
“And so is Hoop.” Hoop tried to look bored
but was quite evidently pleased. “So you all
are,” she concluded, beaming about her.</p>

<p>“We thank you,” said Ned, laying his hand
on his waistcoat in the vicinity of his heart.
“Any little thing we can do for you—”</p>

<p>“I shall never believe in you again, Ned,”
said Molly sadly, “after what Spud told me.
Whenever you say anything nice I shall think
that you’re after my pillow-case.”</p>

<p>“In that case—” began Ned, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
drowned by a chorus of groans. “I shall sneak
another apple,” he finished.</p>

<p>“Sneak one for me, too,” said Hoop.
“Where do these apples grow, Molly?” he
asked carelessly. Molly made a face at him.</p>

<p>“I know but I sha’n’t tell you,” she answered.
“If I did you might all come over
here after some and get caught.”</p>

<p>“No, I was just thinking about next year,”
Hoop assured her. “We never make more
than one raid a year.”</p>

<p>“You will please,” Spud admonished Cal,
“not throw your cores on the club house floor.
Toss them out on the gravel. They look much
better there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s call this a club!” cried Molly
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Right,” Ned agreed. “The Woodshed
Club.”</p>

<p>“The Apple Club would be better,” suggested
Clara.</p>

<p>“No; let me see.” Sandy frowned thoughtfully.
“What kind of apples are these we’ve
been eating, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Newtown Pippins,” answered Molly.</p>

<p>“There you have it, then; the Pippin
Club!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dandy,” said The Fungus. “We’re the
Nine Pippins.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll meet here every Sunday afternoon,”
cried Molly, clapping her hands. “And
this shall be our club house.”</p>

<p>“Um,” observed Ned doubtfully. “Won’t
it be a bit coolish in winter?”</p>

<p>“The house committee,” said Spud, “must
look into the matter of heating the club house.
Steam would do.”</p>

<p>“We ought to elect officers,” suggested
Hoop. “I’ll be president.”</p>

<p>“You dry up. Molly’s president.” This
from Sandy. “And I’ll be secretary. And
Ned shall be—”</p>

<p>“This is a mighty funny election,” interrupted
The Fungus. “What am I?”</p>

<p>“You’re a toadstool,” said Spud severely.
“Sit down and subside. I move that Ned be
elected something and that I be made treasurer.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be anything to treasure,
Spud,” said Molly. “Except the apples.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have initiation fees and dues,”
responded Spud cheerfully. “Pay up, please.
I need the money.”</p>

<p>“Better let Ned be treasurer, then,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Sandy. “He needs the money worse. He’s
shy eight dollars.”</p>

<p>That aroused Molly’s curiosity and she had
to be told of the mysterious disappearance of
Ned’s money, first having been sworn to secrecy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry, Ned!” said Molly.
“And I don’t mind your being a—a diplomat
now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always heard,” remarked The Fungus,
“that diplomacy was an expensive career.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what!” Molly beamed brightly
across at Ned. “I’ll think about it tonight
when I’m going to sleep and see if I can’t
dream where it is, Ned.”</p>

<p>Spud made a gesture of triumph. “Ned,
your money’s as good as found!” he declared.</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t laugh,” Molly protested.
“I have found things that way; once I <em>know</em>
of. When I was a little girl I lost my doll and
I felt just terribly about it. We hunted everywhere
for her, mama and nurse and me. And
I was so unhappy that I cried myself to sleep
after nurse had gone. And in the night I
dreamed that she was hidden under the oak
chest in the hall!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“The nurse?” Ned asked.</p>

<p>“No, my doll, stupid! And when I got up
in the morning I went down and looked and
there she was! Now, wasn’t that—remarkable?”</p>

<p>“It was. But you see, Molly, we haven’t
any oak chest in our hall.”</p>

<p>“We might get one, though,” said Spud
helpfully. Molly pouted.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’re going to make fun of me—”</p>

<p>“We’re not,” protested Ned. “It’s a wonderful
scheme. You go ahead and dream,
Molly, and see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d better eat some mince pie
or a welsh rarebit or something before you go
to bed,” said Sandy, “so you’ll be sure to
dream.”</p>

<p>“I always dream,” replied Molly. “Every
night of my life. And some of them are just
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Wish mine were,” said Spud. “Mine are
just awful. You and Cal ought to compare
symptoms. Cal has a fine time dreaming, don’t
you, Cal? Remember the night Ned lost his
money you dreamed of thieves?”</p>

<p>“Really?” cried Molly. “Then it was
thieves that took your money, Ned!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it was—if the money was taken.
I guess, though, that I just mislaid it.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” said The Fungus admiringly, “you
talk of mislaying eight dollars as though it was
eight cents! Wish I was rich like that.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what you do, Molly,” said Spud.
“You dream about sixteen dollars instead of
eight, and then when Ned finds it you and I’ll
divide the other eight!”</p>

<p>“Spud, you’re too silly for anything,” said
Molly severely.</p>

<p>“He’s a boiled idiot,” Sandy agreed.
“We’ve got to be going, fellows. We’ve had
a very nice time, Molly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, and we’ll come again,” said
The Fungus.</p>

<p>“Next Sunday, then,” Molly replied.
“Don’t forget. The Pippin Club meets every
Sunday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“In their club house on—on Apple Avenue,”
added Spud. “I move a vote of thanks
to the president for her hospitality. All in
favor will signify by taking another apple. It
is so moved. As treasurer I’ll take two.”</p>

<p>“A terrible thought strikes me,” said Dutch
as they left the club house. “We’ll probably
have apple-sauce for supper!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>A groan, loud, prolonged and dismal, arose
on the afternoon air. Spud viewed the two
pippins in his hands and shook his head over
them.</p>

<p>“They don’t look as good as they did,” he
muttered. “I guess I’ll put them back—in
my pocket.”</p>

<p>They said good-bye to Molly at the steps and
then ambled back to West House, munching as
they went.</p>

<small>CAL BUYS A SUIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“House Eleven: Practice at 3:45 sharp
today. No cuts. Brooks, Captain.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like business, what?” asked Spud
of Cal as he read the notice in School Building
Monday morning. “Say, I hope Brooksie
won’t take it out on The Fungus for that
beastly fumble. Wasn’t that the meanest luck
ever? Between you and me, Cal, Fungus ought
to have recovered that ball. He had lots of
time. It looked like a case of stage-fright.
I guess Fungus was so horrified at what he’d
done he couldn’t move for a second. But he
will make good all right if Brooksie doesn’t
take him off today. But I don’t believe he will.
Cap has got a whole lot of common-sense. I
guess that’s one thing that makes him such a
dandy captain.”</p>

<p>Spud was right in his surmise. The Fungus
went back to his place at left half-back that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
afternoon just as though there hadn’t been any
fumble. The only change made was in the substitution
of Folsom for Boyle at full. It was
the hardest practice of the season and lasted
until it was almost too dark to see the ball with
any certainty. Brooks was trying to make his
machine run smoother. All the parts were
there and they represented plenty of power,
but so far the full power hadn’t materialized.
A football team is like, we will say, an engine
which is rated at twenty horse-power. If the
engine runs smoothly it will develop its
twenty, but if the parts aren’t assembled just
right, if each one isn’t timed exactly with the
others, there’s a loss of power and the twenty
is perhaps no better than a fifteen. So it was
with the House Team. Brooks, who had, as
Spud said, a lot of common-sense—and a good
deal of football sense added to it—realized
that his team represented the best of the material
at hand and that if it was to develop the
power of which it was capable it must be perfectly
adjusted. So that afternoon and every
other afternoon that week the constant cry was
“Get together!” The back-field was the chief
offender. Play after play was pulled off—the
team had a repertoire of fourteen at this stage—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
always someone was too early or too
late. Brooks argued and explained and
pleaded and scolded. Ned gave way to H.
Westlake at right half and Morris took
M’Crae’s place at quarter, and still things went
wrong. Hoop went into the line for Brooks so
that the captain might coach from back of the
team. A thing that exasperated Brooks was
that over on the Hall gridiron the rival team
was running through its signals with all the
smoothness that the House eleven lacked. But
Rome wasn’t built in a day and Brooks told
himself that it was something accomplished if
he had only made the fellows understand what
was wanted. Perhaps tomorrow or the next
day they would put his preaching into practice.
It was a very tired group of players and substitutes
that trailed back to the gymnasium at
dusk. The Hall Team had long since disappeared
and they had the gymnasium to themselves.
Brooks, attired scantily in a generous
bath towel, spoke a few words to his weary
team-mates on his way to the shower.</p>

<p>“You fellows can play this game the way
it ought to be played,” he said, “play it well
enough to lick Hall. But you won’t until you
can get it into your heads that a football team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
isn’t made up of eleven fellows each acting for
himself but of eleven fellows acting like one.
You know your plays but you don’t know how
to use them. That’s what the trouble is. Hall
hasn’t any better material than we have in
spite of the fact that she has more fellows to
draw from. But Hall gets together. The line
and the ends and the backs work like so many
different parts of a watch, and the result is
nice smooth football. You fellows in the line
are doing pretty well, but the backs aren’t helping
you along. Now tomorrow I want to see
this team take hold and run through its plays
like clock-work. If it doesn’t there’s going
to be another victory for Hall on Saturday.
I’m doing all I can. Now it’s up to you fellows.”</p>

<p>Brooks disappeared into the bath and there
was a sound of rushing water beyond the canvas
curtain. That’s all the sound there was for
a minute. Then Brad Miller whistled a tune
softly and stole bathward and one after another
the rest followed, as many as there was
room for, while the balance waited, subdued
and chastened.</p>

<p>On Tuesday practice was no less vigorous,
but Brooks let them off after an hour and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
quarter. There was some improvement noticeable.
Cal got in at left tackle for a while and
did very well; so well that Dutch, relegated
to the substitutes, looked distinctly anxious. It
was almost supper time when West House
reached home. On the steps sat Molly, a red
ribbon pinned to the front of her gown in honor
of the Houses. Mrs. Linn had been talking to
her from the doorway but hurried kitchenward
when the boys appeared.</p>

<p>“Didn’t see you at practice, Molly,” said
Ned, throwing himself down wearily on the
steps.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t go today,” answered Molly.
“I was teaching Clara tennis.”</p>

<p>“What? Well, you must be getting on!”</p>

<p>“I don’t play very well, of course, Ned, but
I know what you have to do. And that’s what
I was showing Clara.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Where is he?” Ned looked
about him.</p>

<p>“He—he went upstairs.” Molly hesitated
and looked troubled. “He got hit with a ball.”</p>

<p>“How awful!” laughed Spud. “Did it
kill him?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but it made his nose bleed. It hit
him right square on the nose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Molly!” said Spud in shocked tones.
“Is that the way you treat your opponents?
You ought to be playing football instead of
tennis.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to, Spud. I just hit a ball
across and he was leaning over the net quite
near and didn’t see it coming. It—it bled
horribly.”</p>

<p>“Well, he will be all right,” Sandy said
comfortingly. “Accidents will happen on the
best regulated courts.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” observed Spud, “it isn’t
considered sportsmanlike to maim your enemy,
Molly.” But Molly looked so troubled that
Spud stopped his efforts at teasing. “I see
you’re wearing the right color, Molly.”</p>

<p>“So is Clara,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you don’t beat the Hall next
Saturday I’m going to wear blue,” she answered.
There was a groan of protest at that.</p>

<p>“We’re going to win, though,” said Spud
sturdily, “aren’t we, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I cal’late we’ll put up a good fight,” was
the cautious reply.</p>

<p>“We’re going to win,” said The Fungus
vehemently as he got up. “That’s what we’re
going to do. Now I’ll go up and see how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Clara’s nose is behaving. I hope it isn’t damaged.
It’s a nice little nose.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t damaged, but it presented a reddened
and swollen appearance when Clara
brought it to the supper table a few minutes
later. He had to put up with a good deal of
ragging from the others.</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell Molly to be more careful
with you,” said Spud. “You’re not used to
the gentle ways of women, Clara.”</p>

<p>The incident, however, brought about more
trouble for Molly than for her victim, for the
following noon, when Cal returned from morning
school, Molly called to him from beyond
the lilac hedge that separated the two houses.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said as he went over, “what’s
the matter with you?” For Molly looked extremely
depressed.</p>

<p>“They won’t let me go out of the yard today,”
she said mournfully. “And Hoop was
going to play tennis with me after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t they?” Cal demanded.</p>

<p>“Because I told them about Clara’s nose
and Aunt Matilda said I was to stay at home
until I had learned to be more careful and lady-like.
And I told her I didn’t mean to do it,
too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s a shame,” said Cal warmly. “It
wasn’t your fault.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Matilda says I’m harum-scarum,”
sighed Molly. “Do <em>you</em> think I am, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I—I cal—I guess I don’t just know what
that is,” he answered. “How long have you
got to stay in the yard?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. All of today, anyhow. Why,
what have you done to your coat, Cal Boland?”</p>

<p>“That? That’s just a tear,” replied Cal.
“Hoop and I were tussling this morning.”</p>

<p>“You must have it mended or it will get
worse. Haven’t you another suit you can put
on?”</p>

<p>“Only my Sunday one.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better buy one at once,” she
said severely. “That isn’t fit to be seen
in, Cal. All the other boys look so nice,
too.”</p>

<p>Cal viewed as much of his suit as was in
sight to him and shook his head ruefully.</p>

<p>“I cal’late I’ve got to,” he said. “Seems
like I get into a lot of trouble with my clothes.
This was a perfectly good suit when I came
here.” Molly laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s perfectly good for nothing now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Get a dark suit, Cal, won’t you? You’d look
so much nicer in dark clothes.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Ned said. Dark clothes show
dirt, though, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t show much more dirt than
those do,” replied Molly scornfully. “Just
look at them! You ought to be ashamed to be
seen in them.”</p>

<p>Cal looked a trifle surprised and a little
ashamed.</p>

<p>“I guess they are pretty bad,” he muttered.
“I can have them cleaned, though, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but they’ll never be real nice
again. You could wear them as a sort of second-best,
Cal.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes. It’s sort of a bother, though, having
two suits, I guess. You’d always have to
be changing.”</p>

<p>But when he left her, bearing a message to
Hoop, he went up to his room and composed a
letter to his mother in which he explained the
necessity for new clothes and asked her to send
him twelve dollars. Cal had been to the village
but once since his arrival at school and consequently
he still retained most of his two dollars
and eighty-five cents, and some of this, he calculated,
could be added to the twelve dollars if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
necessary. In the matter of shoes he had been
lucky. His own were showing signs of giving
out, and when Dutch had offered him the loan
of a pair of baseball shoes, with cleated soles,
Cal had thankfully accepted. These he wore
when he played football, so saving his own
shoes a deal of hard usage. The reply to his
letter came promptly two days later.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wanting other things besides a
suit,” wrote his mother, “and so I send you
fifteen dollars instead of the twelve you asked
for. Don’t forget to have your hair cut every
three weeks. It will soon be time for winter
underwear and you are to put on the old ribbed
ones first. They are very warm but won’t last
long. When you come home at Christmas time
I will get you another suit of them. Does Mrs.
Linn keep your socks darned up for you? And
do you need more socks yet, I wonder. There
are some gray wool ones here that belonged to
your father but maybe they would be too thick
for you. Are your shoes holding out? You
were always hard on shoes. Have them mended
before they go to pieces. I am glad you are
getting on so well with your studies and like
your school so much. I wouldn’t play football
very often. The papers are full of accidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to boys playing football. It must be a very
rough game. Nancy is well except for a cold
on her chest and sends love to you....”</p>

<p>There was no practice Friday afternoon, and
Cal went shopping. He wanted to ask Ned
where to look for his suit, but couldn’t bring
himself to do it. He did ask Spud, but Spud
had never purchased clothing other than boots
and stockings and ties in Woodfield and his
advice was vague.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d go to the big store opposite the
Post Office,” he said. “I forget the name,
but you’ll find it all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_299">Cal buys a new suit of clothes</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296-<br />297]</a></span></p>

<p>Cal was hoping that Spud would offer to
accompany him, but Spud was looking over a
few rusty golf clubs and waiting for Brad Miller
to call and take him over to the links. So
Cal went off by himself. He had never bought
a suit of clothes unassisted and was filled with
misgivings. But they were extraordinarily polite
and attentive at Simmons’s Boston Store
and it was all over before he knew it and he
was trudging back to West House with a big
pasteboard box under his arm. The clerk had
offered to deliver it for him in the morning,
but Cal, now that he had made the purchase,
was eager to get it home and have a good look
at himself in the mirror. The house was empty
when he reached it, although Hoop and Clara
and Molly were playing tennis outside. He
tried the new suit on and looked it over. It
was necessary to get on to a chair in order to
see the bottoms of the trousers and when he
saw them Cal had a vague suspicion that they
terminated with far too many wrinkles. He
wished he might have Ned’s opinion on them.
At least, though, he had followed advice and
bought a dark suit, and one, too, that wouldn’t
easily show dirt. The goods was a strange
mixture of black and white, the white consisting
of faint lines forming a double plaid. In
effect the suit was dark gray, almost an Oxford
at a distance. The surface was quite rough
and seemed to contain more than an ordinary
share of tiny splinters of wood.</p>

<p>“I cal’late,” he told himself, “this sheep
must have lived in a lumber yard!”</p>

<p>The clothes didn’t look nearly as natty as
they had at the store and the coat had a perverse
way of settling away from his neck at
the back. Also, the vest—waistcoat, the man
had called it—was decidedly tight across his
chest. He wondered whether Marm couldn’t
set the top button over a little for him. No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
on the whole, he wasn’t nearly so satisfied with
his purchase as he had been at the Boston
Store, but he cal’lated it would do. He guessed
it would have to! He got out of it and hung
it up in the closet and stowed the box on a shelf.
Tomorrow he would put it on and have Marm
mend the suit he was wearing. Then he would
have it cleaned, if they didn’t ask too much,
and perhaps it would last him until Christmas.
There was one thing to be said for his new
clothes, he reflected as he made his way downstairs,
and that was that they had cost him
even less than he had dared hope for. Nine
dollars and eighty-five cents wasn’t much for
a whole suit. And he had almost eight dollars
left! He cal’lated—no, he <em>guessed</em> he wasn’t
such a poor shopper after all!</p>

<p>Downstairs he found that most of West
House had returned and were watching the
tennis. Only Dutch and Spud were absent.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cal,” was the greeting of The Fungus.
“What you been doing? Grinding?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been down town,” answered Cal.</p>

<p>“Thunder! Wish I could go. But what’s
the use when you haven’t any coin? Did you
bring anything home with you? Any peanuts
or chocolate, Cal?” But Cal shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“<a href="#i_p295">I just bought a suit of clothes</a>,” he said.</p>

<p>“Really?” The news seemed to affect them
all, The Fungus, Ned and Sandy, with lively
interest and surprise. “Think of that! Why,
Cal, you’ll be a regular Beau Brummel.”</p>

<p>Cal didn’t know what that was, but he smiled
good-naturedly. “It’s just a cheap suit,”
he explained. “This one’s getting sort of
shabby.”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it,” laughed Sandy,
“it does seem a bit worn about the edges.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you buy it?” asked Ned gruffly.</p>

<p>“Simmons’s.”</p>

<p>“Rotten hole,” Ned grunted. “I told you
where to go.”</p>

<p>“I forgot where you said,” answered Cal
meekly.</p>

<p>“Could have asked, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to.” Sandy and The Fungus
exchanged glances. That something was very
wrong between Ned and Cal had been apparent
for some time, but what it was no one could
guess.</p>

<p>“Bet you you got stung,” said Ned with
more than a trace of satisfaction in his tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t cal’late I did,” answered Cal
calmly. “I only paid nine eighty-five.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Further discussion of the subject was
stopped by Molly, Hoop and Clara, who had
finished their set and now joined the others on
the steps.</p>

<p>“He only beat us six to three,” announced
Molly triumphantly, nodding at Hoop. “Don’t
you think we did pretty well?”</p>

<p>“I guess it would have been closer if I
hadn’t been in it,” said Clara.</p>

<p>“You did splendidly! Didn’t he, Hoop?”</p>

<p>“He will learn all right, Molly.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t hit you on the nose again, did
they?” asked Ned. Clara reddened and shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I guess I never will,” Molly laughed. “It
cost me two days in jail.”</p>

<p>“It was a pretty big jail,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it seems pretty small when you
know you can’t get out of it!”</p>

<p>“By the way, Molly,” asked The Fungus,
“did you ever dream what had become of
Ned’s money?” Molly’s face fell and she
sighed.</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly. I tried three times,
too. The first time—that was Sunday night,
you know—I did dream something but I
couldn’t quite remember it in the morning.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
She wrinkled her forehead. “It was something,
though, about apples; and Cal was in
it, too. But I don’t seem to remember dreaming
about the money.”</p>

<p>“Funny you should have dreamed of apples,”
laughed Sandy.</p>

<p>“Not half as funny as dreaming about Cal,”
said Hoop. “What you had was a nightmare,
Molly.”</p>

<p>“Produced by too many pippins,” added
The Fungus.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try again,” she said cheerfully.
“I’m sure that was a perfectly good
dream—if I only could have remembered it.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Ned soothingly. “Like the
Irishman’s horse. It was a perfectly good
horse, only it was dead.”</p>

<small>A FALLING-OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next morning Cal awoke with a feeling
of excitement difficult to account for during
the first moments of consciousness. Then
he remembered that today was the day of the
second football contest and that his new suit
of clothes awaited him in the closet. He
wasn’t sure which excited him the most, the
football game or the new clothes. Anyway,
the latter came first. He sprang out of bed,
washed and then got the suit from the closet.
Ned, sitting on the edge of his bed, looked on
silently, unwashed and undressed, while his
roommate clothed himself in the new apparel.
Cal pulled at the waistcoat in a vain endeavor
to make it set better and yanked the coat up at
the back in the hope that it would somewhere
come into relationship with his collar. Both
efforts were fruitless. All the time he was
embarrassedly aware of Ned’s unflinching
stare. At last Ned spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take them off,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Wh-what?”</p>

<p>“Take them off.”</p>

<p>“Why? What for? What’s the matter with
them?” Cal faltered.</p>

<p>“Matter!” cried Ned. “What isn’t the
matter? They look—they look like a couple
of gunny-sacks! They don’t fit anywhere!
The trousers are the same size all the way
down and are three inches too long for you.
The vest wrinkles across the top and the
coat—” Words failed him for a moment.
“The coat is the worst I ever saw! It doesn’t
touch you anywhere except on the shoulders, and
one sleeve’s an inch longer than the other!
Matter with it! Gee, what’s right with it?”</p>

<p>“It—it was cheap,” Cal defended.</p>

<p>“It looks it!” was the disgusted reply.
“It’s the ugliest cloth I ever saw in my life.
We used to have a Newfoundland dog that was
about twelve years old and had grown gray
and grizzled. I couldn’t stand looking at that
suit, Cal. It would remind me too much of
poor old Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve bought it and—”</p>

<p>“Take it off!” commanded Ned inexorably.
“I’m not going to have any fellow that rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
with me make a show of himself if I can help
it.”</p>

<p>“But—but what can I do?” asked Cal
discouragedly, eyeing the subject of Ned’s disparagement
with sudden distaste. “I’ve paid
for it.”</p>

<p>“And you paid enough for it, too. What
can you do? You do as I tell you. You take
it off and bundle it up. After breakfast I’ll
go to the village with you and I’ll pick out a
suit that doesn’t look like poor old Charlie.”</p>

<p>“You mean—change it? Will they let
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course they will, though they won’t
want to, maybe. I’ll bet the clerk that got rid
of that suit to you got a raise in salary last
night!”</p>

<p>“It looked a lot better in the store,” murmured
Cal.</p>

<p>“Yes; well we’ll take it back to the store.
That’s where it belongs. My, but you were
easy, weren’t you? How much did you say it
cost?”</p>

<p>“Nine dollars and eighty-five cents,” replied
Cal meekly.</p>

<p>“Nine dollars too much, then. Was that all
you could pay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but it looked like a perfectly good—”</p>

<p>“I guess they hypnotized you, Cal,” sighed
Ned, beginning to dress himself. “Don’t
let the other fellows see it, <em>please</em>; take
it off right now before anything happens to
it.”</p>

<p>Cal obeyed. He didn’t for a moment resent
Ned’s criticism, for the suspicion that his purchase
was not all he had thought it had already
taken hold of him. Besides, it was awfully
nice to have Ned talk to him, even if he was
cross. He got into his old suit again, folded
the new one back into the pasteboard box and
tied it up.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t have to go with me,
Ned,” he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t I? I wouldn’t trust you to buy a—a
paper collar after this! You bet I’ll go with
you!”</p>

<p>So after breakfast they started off together,
Cal with the big box under his arm. Now that
the matter was settled they seemed to have
nothing more to say to each other and trudged
along in perfect silence for the first quarter of
a mile. Cal would have liked to talk. His
resentment, he discovered to his surprise, had
disappeared and his liking and admiration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Ned, which, he saw now, had only been smothered
out of sight, made him want to get back
again to the old friendly footing. When they
turned into the cross road Cal summoned courage
and spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s good of you to bother, Ned,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Ned grimly. “When I pay
for anything I want it decent; that’s all.”
The tone was decidedly ungracious, while the
more Cal pondered the words the less he liked
them.</p>

<p>“When <em>you</em> pay for anything?” he repeated
questioningly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” answered Ned without
turning.</p>

<p>Cal felt the blood creeping up into his
face, but he went on in silence for a minute.
Then,</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Ned?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p>“What I said.”</p>

<p>Another minute went by. The resentment
and anger that had been simmering in Cal
for a long time was threatening to boil
over, but he strove hard to hold his temper
in check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“I paid for this suit myself, didn’t I?” he
asked presently. Ned made no reply. Cal repeated
the question: “Didn’t I, Ned?”</p>

<p>“So you say,” answered the other carelessly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that I did?” Cal’s voice
was trembling.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Ned ironically. Cal scowled
and clenched his hands. Then,</p>

<p>“Look here,” he burst out, “you think I
stole that money of yours, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I never accused you of it,” replied Ned in
an ugly tone.</p>

<p>“But you think so.”</p>

<p>“My thoughts are my own, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not! You might as well say
it as think it. I never even saw your old
money. Now, do you believe that?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, and then Ned
turned and looked his room-mate squarely in
the face.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of lying, Cal?” he asked
with a shrug of his shoulders. “You were
the only fellow who knew the money was
there, and Spud saw you at my bureau that
night.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t out of bed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, you were,” replied Ned calmly, “for
I saw you too.”</p>

<p>“You—saw me!” gasped Cal in amazement.
Ned nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I woke up for a minute and saw you
by the window. I was sleepy and paid no attention
and went to sleep again. I didn’t think
anything of it until Spud spoke of it after I’d
missed the money.”</p>

<p>“You must have dreamed it! I tell you I
wasn’t out of bed that night, Ned!” declared
Cal earnestly.</p>

<p>“All right, say I did dream it,” answered
Ned wearily. “Say Spud and I both dreamed
the same thing. It doesn’t matter now. Only,
for the love of Mike, don’t act as though I’d
hurt you. I won’t stand that—that confounded
injured innocence of yours. Hang it,
I did all I could to keep the other fellows from
guessing, but I’m not going to pretend that you
didn’t take it just to please you! You needed
the money and you took it. You ought to be
satisfied.”</p>

<p>“You lie, Ned!”</p>

<p>“I do, eh?” said Ned angrily. “Where’d
you get the money to pay for those clothes,
I’d like to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“My mother sent it. I wrote home for it.
I can show you her letter. I didn’t take your
money, and—and—”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie about it, I tell you!” cried Ned
hotly. “If you must steal—”</p>

<p>“I cal’late <a href="#i_p311">we’d better settle this right
now</a>,” interrupted the other, ominously calm.
He dropped the box at the side of the road
and stepped toward Ned with white face
and blazing eyes. There was no one in
sight in either direction. Ned shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to fight you,” he sneered.
“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to,” said Cal grimly, clenching
his hands.</p>

<p>“I like that! Swipe my coin and then want
to lick me!”</p>

<p>The next instant he was reeling back toward
the grass, for Cal had struck him fair on the
face with the palm of his hand. Ned steadied
himself and stared.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” he said quietly. “I
don’t want to fight with a thief, but I will!”</p>

<p>Ned was Cal’s senior by nine months, but his
superiority ended there, for the younger boy
was stronger and harder of muscle. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
had they stuck to scientific methods Ned would
have won that short engagement, for Cal knew
little of boxing. His methods were primitive
but effective. He met Ned’s rush as best he
might, receiving a blow on his chin that staggered
him for an instant, and then sprang past
the other’s guard, threw his arms around him
and strove to throw him. Ned rained blows
against Cal’s head, but they were too short to
do much damage. For a moment they swayed
there, panting and gasping in the middle of
the dusty road, Ned hammering short blows
against the back of his adversary’s head and
Cal paying no heed to them, intent only on getting
Ned at his mercy. At last he managed to
get one arm across Ned’s chest and gripped his
shoulder. At the same instant he put a knee
behind the other and in a twinkling they were
flat in the weeds by the roadside, a cloud of
dust about them. But Cal was on top, and
although Ned struggled and writhed, he held
his place. There were no blows struck now.
Cal had Ned at his mercy and knew it. And
it wasn’t long before Ned realized it too and
stopped struggling.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” he panted. “I’m down. Hit
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312-<br />313]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to if you don’t take it back,”
answered Cal grimly. “I’m going to hit you
till you say you believe me. Do you?”</p>

<p>The white, strained faces were close and two
pairs of angry eyes glared hatred at each other.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>Cal raised a fist.</p>

<p>“You’d better. I didn’t take your money.
Believe that?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>But the blow didn’t fall. Cal’s eyes fell instead.</p>

<p>“I cal’late I can’t,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Go ahead! You—you thief! Hit me! I
dare you to!”</p>

<p>Again Cal raised his closed hand and again
it dropped back. Tears came to his eyes.
“Gee, Ned, I just can’t!” he sobbed. For a
long moment the two boys looked at each other.
Then Ned’s eyes closed.</p>

<p>“Let me up, Cal,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>Cal released him and arose. Ned climbed to
his feet, picked his cap from the dust and examined
his bleeding knuckles.</p>

<p>“Suppose there’s any water around here?”
he asked. Cal shook his head.</p>

<p>“There’s the brook further along,” he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
subduedly. He picked up his own cap
and rescued his box.</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” said Ned.</p>

<p>They went on along the road to the brook in
silence. There Ned laved his bruised and
swollen hand, and Cal, wetting his handkerchief,
held it to his chin. Presently they went on
again, Cal hugging the box. Nothing was said
until they reached the main road and the village
lay in sight ahead. Then Ned turned curiously
to his companion.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you hit, Cal?” he asked. Cal
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ned. I just couldn’t, somehow.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Ned presently, “we’re a
couple of idiots, Cal.” Cal nodded without
looking at him. It was almost a block further
along that Ned spoke again.</p>

<p>“You didn’t, Cal,” he said. “I don’t know
how I know it, but I do. I—I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Cal nodded, his gaze straight ahead.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he muttered.</p>

<small>THE SECOND GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ned took entire charge of the negotiations
at the clothing store and all Cal had to do
was to stand by, listen, watch and try on the
various suits that were brought forth. Ned
refused to consider anything under twelve dollars.</p>

<p>“Those cheap things don’t pay, Cal,” he
said decisively. “They’re just shoddy; not
an ounce of wool in them; and they won’t wear
two weeks without getting to look like rags.”</p>

<p>“The suit I brought back,” confided Cal in
a voice lowered so as not to pain the salesman,
“seemed to be most all splinters and pieces of
bur.”</p>

<p>“All wood and a yard wide,” commented
Ned with no effort to moderate his voice and
no concern for the clerk’s feelings. “Probably
made from one of those wooden sheep you see
in the toy-shops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Ned was suited, and, without intending
a pun, so was Cal. The suit selected was a
rough mixture that the salesman called a Harris
tweed but which Ned was certain had never
crossed the water. It was gray in effect, but
close examination revealed a little of every
color known. It was really rather stylish and
had at the same time the merit, approved of
Cal, of not readily showing dirt. The price was
twelve dollars and Cal went down into his
pocket for an additional two dollars and fifteen
cents. Then Ned insisted on the purchase of
a blue necktie, price thirty-five cents, and a
leather belt at half a dollar. Cal was growing
uneasy and was very glad when the suit was
boxed and delivered to him and he could hurry
out before Ned discovered any further extravagances
for him to indulge in.</p>

<p>On the way home they talked quite frankly
of the mystery of Ned’s missing eight dollars.
“Of course, Cal,” said his room-mate, “I
might have been mistaken about seeing you up
that night, but it’s hard to believe. Still, you
ought to know whether you were up or not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand that,” said Cal. “I’m
just certain sure that I wasn’t out of bed, but
both you and Spud saw someone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I’d say it was a burglar, only it
isn’t likely a burglar would parade around in
night-clothes, is it? Of course, it might have
been one of the other fellows in there for some
joke or other. Maybe when he heard about the
money being missing he didn’t like to fess
up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that was it!” cried Cal with relief.
“Only—only where did the money get to?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been saying lately that I thought
I’d just naturally put it somewhere and forgotten
about it, and now I’m beginning to think
that’s what really happened, Cal. Only where
the dickens did I put it? I’ve looked all over
the shop.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite sure you didn’t spend it?”
asked Cal.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Gee, if I spent eight dollars
I guess I’d have something to show for it,
wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” laughed Cal. “Unless you
blew it all in on sodas and candy.”</p>

<p>“Even then I’d have a jolly good tummy-ache
to remember it by!”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll find it some time, Ned.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Say, how’s your chin?”</p>

<p>“Hurts sort of. So does my head, I cal’late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
I’ve got some lumps back there.” Cal felt
and nodded gravely. “Dandies,” he added.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Ned said. “But I want you
to know that I’ve got a bunch of sore knuckles
here, too.” He viewed them aggrievedly. “I
guess we’ll have to fake up a yarn to tell the
fellows at the house.”</p>

<p>“Say we were scuffling and fell,” said Cal.
“That’s true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“True enough, I guess. Though I don’t just
see how you managed to fall on the side of your
chin.”</p>

<p>“I cal—guess we won’t have to give any
details,” answered Cal. “What time is it?
I’m fearfully hungry.”</p>

<p>Ned looked at his watch and they hastened
their pace, reaching West House a quarter of
an hour before dinner time. At table Cal’s chin
didn’t go unnoticed, and although the explanation
tendered was accepted without protest the
rest of West House knew very well that Ned
and Cal had had more than a scuffle. But whatever
had happened had cleared the air. That
was very evident. The occupants of the Den
now seemed as unwilling to lose sight of each
other for an instant as before they had been unwilling
to remain together. Dinner was an excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
function that day, for everyone’s thoughts
were on the football game at two-thirty and the
coming contest was talked of over and over.</p>

<p>“We’ll get licked worse than last time,” declared
Sandy.</p>

<p>“Then there won’t be any third game?”
asked Clara disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there will. We play three games
anyhow,” The Fungus reassured him. “And it
isn’t very often that the third game isn’t the—the
crucial one.”</p>

<p>“Great talk, Fungus,” Dutch applauded.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a peach of a word,” agreed
Spud. “Got any more like it, Toadstool? I
like to use ’em when I write home. Makes folks
think I’m really learning lots.” Then, seeing
his opportunity to engage Sandy in dispute,
something that Spud loved above all things, he
turned to the House Leader. “You’re all
wrong, though, Sandy, about our getting licked
this afternoon. Can’t be did.”</p>

<p>“I hope I am wrong,” answered Sandy pessimistically,
“but I can’t figure it out that
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can. For one thing, you know
mighty well that House has improved about
fifty per cent. in team-play this last week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s improved, yes, but not any fifty per
cent. And what do you suppose Hall has been
doing? Standing still? Young Hoyt told me
this morning that they’ve come on like anything.”</p>

<p>“So have we,” said Spud stoutly. “Our
backs are every bit as good as theirs, while as
for the line, why, I can’t see but what we had
it on them a bit last game.”</p>

<p>“If only we had a couple of good ends,”
lamented Hoop.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dry up and blow away! Say, Hoop,
is it true that Brooksie is going to let you carry
the water pail today?”</p>

<p>“If I do you won’t get any of it!”</p>

<p>“And you won’t be able to carry it if you
don’t stop eating pretty soon. Better speak
to him, Sandy. That’s his third dip in the
mash.”</p>

<p>“That’s a whopper,” growled Hoop. “I’ve
only had potatoes twice; haven’t I, Marm?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Hoop, but they won’t hurt
you, surely. Potatoes never hurt anyone. Vegetarians
always eat lots of potatoes.”</p>

<p>“So do Episcopalians,” murmured Spud.
“Pass ’em this way, please, somebody.”</p>

<p>“You’d all better go slow on eating,” cautioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Sandy. “The game will be called in
an hour and a half.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, I’ll be hungry again by that time,”
said Dutch.</p>

<p>At half-past one they set out for the gymnasium,
all save Clara, who had promised to
take Molly over to see the game and who went
over to the Curtis’s to get her. Even Mrs. Linn
was going, but couldn’t leave her house yet.
As the first contest had taken place on the Hall
gridiron, today’s was scheduled for the House
field. On each side settees from the gymnasium
were being strung along for the accommodation
of the audience, a small and select one. The
faculty, in order to avoid any appearance of
partiality, distributed themselves on both sides
of the gridiron. Today Doctor Webster and
his family were seated amongst the Hall supporters,
while Mr. Spander, Mr. Kendall, and
Mr. Fordyce, although residents of the Hall,
were mingling with the wearers of the red.
Mr. James, attired in a pair of gray trousers
and an old Dartmouth sweater, was to referee.
The umpire was a man from the village. The
afternoon was bright and fairly warm, with a
mild westerly breeze down the field. The scene
was a very pretty one, the red and blue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
players scattered over the green field and of
the substitutes on the side-lines supplying spots
of vivid color.</p>

<p>Clara and Molly reached the field only a few
minutes before the game began. The rival
teams were already practising and footballs
were arching up and down against the blue of
the autumn sky. They found seats near the
middle of the gridiron on the House side
amongst a scattering of non-combatants. Molly
had plenty of attention, for by this time she
had become acquainted with most of the boys
of the two Houses and not a few Hall residents.
Young Hoyt, a substitute back for the Hall
Team, joined them and tried to persuade Molly
to substitute a blue arm-band for the red
streamer she wore. But Hoyt was in the enemy’s
country and was speedily driven away,
laughingly defiant.</p>

<p>“You’ll wish you had this when the game’s
over, Molly,” he warned her. “Get your winning
colors!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Linn arrived on the scene, flushed and
out of breath, just as Frank Brooks and Pete
Grow were tossing for choice of goal. Mrs.
Butterfield, matron at East House, made room
for her beside her and a discussion of the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of preserving began at once and lasted practically
all through the game. Marm declared
afterwards, however, that it was the most interesting
football game she had ever seen.
Grow won the toss and took the west goal, thus
getting the wind in Hall’s favor, and the teams
arranged themselves while House and Hall
cheered their warriors.</p>

<p>It was evident even from the first moment
that Brooks had succeeded in working a big
improvement in his team, for after getting the
kick-off House worked the ball well past the
middle of the field, making two first downs before
losing it by an on-side kick that went
wrong. And when placed on the defensive
House still showed improvement over last
week’s form. But Hall had been coming too,
and Sawyer, the big full-back, made good gains
through the red line. But Grow realized that
with the wind favoring him his game was to
punt and so get the ball within scoring distance.
In the middle of the field Grow himself dropped
out of the line and sent off a long high spiral
that the wind helped considerably and The Fungus
caught it on House’s ten yard-line and
dodged back to the twenty before he was
downed. Boyle and Ned, alternating, took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
pigskin back to the thirty-five yards and there
M’Crae punted. The ball was Hall’s on her
fifty yards, and after two plunges that fell short
of the required distance Grow kicked again.
This time the ball went over the goal-line and
M’Crae touched it back.</p>

<p>House elected to put it in scrimmage on the
twenty-five yards, but was soon forced to punt
once more. This time luck favored the Red, for
Hall’s right half misjudged the ball, tipped it
with his fingers and was then pushed aside by
Spud, who fell on it on the Hall’s forty-five
yard-line. The handful of House supporters
cheered wildly. But House lost the pigskin
presently on downs and Hall tried an end run
that worked beautifully around Miller and
landed the oval just inside House territory.
Sawyer was thrown for a loss and again Grow
punted. M’Crae didn’t do that punt justice, for
he misjudged its distance sadly and had to
chase back to almost his goal-line after it.
Luckily he was afforded good protection from
the Hall’s ends and was able to scoop it up
and dodge back to his fifteen yard-line before
he was smothered.</p>

<p>House set to work then and uncovered a
couple of new plays that caught Hall off her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
guard and advanced the ball to the forty yards.
There, however, Hall’s line tightened, an end
run lost ground and House was set back five
yards for being off-side. M’Crae therefore was
forced to kick. It was a poor attempt and went
out near the center of the field. Hall worked
Miller’s end once more and again tore off a
good gain there. A second attempt, however,
was spoiled and Hall tried a forward pass. It
succeeded nicely and it was first down for the
Hall near the side of the field on House’s thirty-five
yards. Hall tried a skin-tackle play toward
the center of the gridiron, but House was expecting
it and Hall was piled up for a scant
gain of a yard. Sawyer tried a plunge straight
through center and found an opening that
suited him beautifully and would have made his
six yards a touchdown had not House’s secondary
defence been on the alert. With three
yards to go on third down Grow decided to try
a drop-kick at goal, although the angle was a
difficult one. Very calmly he stepped back and
held out his hands and along the side-lines substitutes
and spectators held their breath. Center
made a good pass and although House came
tearing, jumping through with up-stretched
hands, the pigskin sailed away in a low curve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
toward the cross-bar. But the wind which so
far had aided Pete’s fortunes now favored the
adversary by turning the ball’s flight to the
left so that it passed a scant foot outside the
post.</p>

<p>House capered with glee and the wearers of
the Red along the side-lines expressed relief
in cheers. That was the last time either goal
was threatened in the first half and when the
twenty-five minutes of playing time had expired
the pigskin was almost in the exact center of
the field, just about where it had started, which,
when you come to think of it, must have been a
trifle discouraging to the pigskin, whatever the
players thought about it!</p>

<p>“If we can do as well in the next half,” said
Spud to Sandy as they trotted back to the gymnasium,
“we’ll stand a good show of scoring.”</p>

<p>“I think the wind is going down,” answered
Sandy gloomily.</p>

<p>“Going down fiddlesticks! You’re an old
grump, Sandy!”</p>

<p>Back on the field Molly had a very good time
during the intermission, for the Second Juniors
of House and Hall were very attentive. Mrs.
Linn discovered her, too, and she was presented
to Mrs. Butterfield and Mrs. Kendall, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
matron at the Hall and wife of the mathematics
instructor. When Mrs. Kendall invited
Molly to come and see her at the Hall Clara
scowled. To visit at the Hall savored to him
of high treason, especially during the football
season! Molly also met Mr. Kendall. Grouch,
as the boys called him, could be very pleasant
on occasions and this proved to be one of the
occasions. The boys looked on in amazement
while he laughed and conversed with Molly,
for so much amiability on the part of the
teacher was unprecedented in their experience.</p>

<p>House began the second half of the game with
the breeze at her back, and Brooks’s kick-off
went over the goal-line. From the twenty-five
yards Hall worked back to near the center of
the field and there lost the ball on a fumble.
The Fungus got a nasty whack on the head in
this melee and had to be doctored up a bit before
play could go on. A few minutes later
Brooks sent him off and H. Westlake took his
place. M’Crae kicked on second down from
Hall’s forty yards and the ball was caught on
the five yard-line. House cheered mightily at
that, but Hall started in to rip things up and
tore off twenty yards by a bewildering variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of smoothly working plays before House got together
and stopped her. Then over-eagerness
cost House five yards for off-side and after
another attempt at the line Hall kicked. Westlake,
at left half, ran the pigskin back fifteen
yards by excellent dodging, and House started
for Hall’s goal. For the first time in that period
House got thoroughly together and the
plays went off like clock-work. Across the fifty-five
yard-line the teams went, Hall retreating
stubbornly, and across the forty-five, Ned and
Boyle making good gains through the left of
Hall’s line. There, however, the Blue tightened
up. A plunge by Ned netted a scant two yards
and Boyle could do no better. M’Crae went
back to kick, but for once Hall broke through,
and the quarter, finding himself besieged,
dodged off to the left with the ball under his
arm. But although he ran half-way across the
field, throwing off tackler after tackler, he was
unable to find a place to turn in and was at last
brought down on the side-line. House had
failed of her distance by a couple of yards and
Hall took the pigskin.</p>

<p>For the next ten minutes play was confined
between one forty yard-line and the other.
M’Crae and Brooks took turn at booting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
leather, but their gains on kicks were not great,
for Hall’s backs always managed to run the
ball in five or ten yards before being stopped.
Spud showed himself a good end that day, but
Miller was slow and uncertain and it wasn’t
long before Welch was given his place. Hall
made two changes. Harris substituted McDonald
at quarter because of his greater kicking
ability and Barnes took Borden’s place at left
half. Already fifteen minutes of the twenty-five
had expired and the spectators were beginning
to reconcile themselves to a scoreless contest.
But there is no telling what is to happen
in a football game.</p>

<p>It was House’s ball on her own forty-five
yards. Boyle plunged at center and secured
three yards. Then M’Crae dropped back as
though to kick and the ball went at a side pass
to Ned who ran wide into the field, with good
interference, and found his chance of turning
in. Apparently a run of any distance was out
of the question, for the blue-stockinged youths
were all about him. But Westlake spilled one,
Ned dodged a second, Spud put a third out of
the way, and almost before anyone realized it,
Ned had a practically clear field before him.
Behind him came friend and foe alike, stumbling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
falling, going down together often
enough, and in front of him were quarter and
left half. Ned feinted near the forty yards and
shook off the clutch of the half-back, but quarter
was wary and in a moment that run was over
and Ned was down, thrown out of bounds on the
thirty yard-line. But it had been soul-stirring
while it lasted and House cheered from the side
of the field.</p>

<p>In came the ball fifteen paces and it was
House’s first down. If she could only work
nearer the center of the field, a goal from placement
or drop-kick would be practicable. But
naturally Hall was expecting such an attempt
and Westlake’s try around Smith’s end lost
House a yard. But the ball was in front of the
right-hand goal-post, and Boyle, on second
down, smashed through left-tackle for a dozen
feet. It was now House’s chance to win the
game if win she could. Brooks and M’Crae
consulted hurriedly. The ball was near the
twenty-five yard-line and a placement kick was
more certain if the House line could hold. But
it had given way once today and Brooks feared
that it might again. So M’Crae was directed
to try a drop-kick. The little quarter-back
turned and walked to his place behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
thirty-five yard-line, held out his hands and
gave the signal.</p>

<p>“Now hold them!” called Brooks.</p>

<p>Back went the ball, straight but too high.
The lines heaved for an instant and then the
blue jerseys broke through here and there and
sprang toward the path of the ball. M’Crae’s
foot swung forward and the ball sped upward
and away, barely missing one eager, frantic
hand. Down went M’Crae, with the Hall center
on top of him. There was one tense instant
of suspense, an instant in which it seemed at
first that the kick would fall short of the bar.
But M’Crae had counted on the wind and the
wind did its duty. Down settled the pigskin,
turning lazily over and over and for a brief
moment something obscured it. That something
was a wooden cross-bar. House had
scored!</p>

<p>Eleven red-shirted youths leaped about like
maniacs. Spud did a series of hand-springs
and Boyle, only one generation from the Ould
Sod, jumped into the air and cracked his heels
together gayly. On the House side of the field
Molly stood on a settee and shrieked shrilly,
small juniors shouted and capered, substitutes
waved blankets and sweaters and members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the faculty smiled and clapped their hands approvingly.
Across the gridiron the Hall supporters
cheered earnestly in the face of defeat.</p>

<p>Three to nothing was good enough if only
House could keep the score at that. With seven
minutes of playing time left she started in
again with every effort bent on defence. Hall
now had the wind in her favor again and Harris
put all his strength into his kicks. Slowly
House was forced back. But the sands were
running and there was but five minutes remaining.
And now, with the ball in House’s possession
under the shadow of her own goal, but
four. A plunge at left guard; two yards. A
slide off right tackle; two yards more. Brooks,
tired and panting, stepped back under the
cross-bar.</p>

<p>“Hold them hard, fellows!” he cried
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Back came the ball, but with it, alas, came
half the blue team! Yells and grunts; the
crashing of bodies; confusion and pandemonium!
The whistle shrilled. Behind the goal-line
was a writhing mass of blue legs and red,
but where was the ball? Into the pile dived the
referee.</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[334-<br />335]</a></span></p>

<p>Off tumbled one player, Williams of Hall.
Another, that was Sandy, and a third, that was
Pete Grow. It was like pulling sacks of meal
from a pile. A blue player and a red, a red
player and a blue, until, finally, the bottom was
reached and Jim, squirming through with his
hand, found the ball. “Get up, I tell you!”
he demanded. And there at the bottom, with
every breath crushed out of him for the moment,
lay Dutch with the ball clutched to his
breast in a death-like grip.</p>

<p>“Safety,” said Mr. James. “Look after
that man, Brooks.”</p>

<p>House players slapped each other on the back
and grinned joyfully. Hall had scored a safety,
but it had looked for a moment like a touchdown.
House was still in the lead, the score
three to two. Dutch was sponged with cold
water and his arms were pumped up and down,
and presently he rolled over and drew a dozen
good long breaths and then was pulled to his
feet.</p>

<p>“You go off,” said Brooks. “Send in Boland.”</p>

<p>So <a href="#i_p333">Cal had his first baptism by fire</a> in the
succeeding two and a half minutes that remained,
a time all too short for him to get over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
his stage-fright. Luckily the enemy didn’t assail
his position very strongly and none discovered
what a state of nervousness he was in.
A few flights of the ball, an end run that was
nipped in the bud, a half-dozen hopeless, desperate
plunges at the red line and the game
was over, and House ran joyously off the field,
victory perched on her banners.</p>

<small>RUMORS AND EXCITEMENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Houses celebrated that night. There
was no telling what might happen a week
hence and it was well to make the most of the
opportunity. There was a bonfire down in the
corner of the field, a place sacred to such occasions,
and West House and East House cheered
themselves hoarse, while Hall, standing apart,
jeered and tried to drown the sounds of triumph.
Heroes had been made that day and
their names were William L. M’Crae and Otto
Zoller. Brooks made a speech. He said he
didn’t want to throw cold water on the joyous
occasion but wanted to remind them that there
was another game coming.</p>

<p>“Cheer and shout all you want to, fellows,
but while you’re doing it make up your minds
to go into the next game and do a whole lot
better. If you do we’ll have a celebration here
next Saturday night that will make this look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
like a flash in the pan. Remember that
there’s something hanging in the living-room
at the Hall that must come down from there.
Play for the Silver Shield, fellows, and the
Houses!”</p>

<p>Even after West House was home again nobody
was able to quiet down, and when bedtime
came the boys went down in a body and secured
an extension of time from Mrs. Linn. “Just
a half-hour more, Marm,” pleaded Sandy.
“You know we don’t win every day, and I dare
say we won’t again for a while.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Marm. “But I declare I don’t
know what the Doctor would say!”</p>

<p>“If you behave very nicely, Marm, we’ll
never tell him,” Spud assured her.</p>

<p>So they went back to the Ice Chest and talked
it all over again for the twentieth time and were
very excited and jubilant. And Cal, who had
played in his first game, was football-mad and
couldn’t hear enough of it. And the next day,
even had they been ready to talk of something
else, which they were not, Molly wouldn’t have
let them. The Pippin Club met in the club
house on Apple Avenue after dinner and Molly
had to hear the personal experiences of each
of the players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, oh, Dutch,” she exclaimed rapturously,
“how did you ever manage to get that
ball so wonderfully.”</p>

<p>Dutch shrugged his shoulders and grinned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” he said. “The ball was bobbing
around on the ground there and someone came
along and gave me a shove that sent me sprawling
on my nose. Then I happened to see Mr.
Ball rolling along near-by and a Hall chap trying
to snuggle up to it. So I reached out and
got it just in time. He didn’t want to let go,
but I pulled it away somehow and worked it
under me. Then they began falling on my head
and back and I didn’t know much more until
they turned me over.”</p>

<p>“Modest youth!” murmured Spud admiringly.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you saved the day,” insisted
Molly beamingly. “And Ned made a beautiful
run, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I’d have made it beautifuller,” grunted
Ned, “if I hadn’t turned my ankle when I
started. That lost time, you see.”</p>

<p>“It was a very good run,” said Spud judicially.
“I’ll say that, Ned. But you all realize,
of course, that it was only made possible
by my excellent assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Spud,” said Molly, “I didn’t know
you helped.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t? Why, I was the interference.
It was this way, Molly. ‘Spud,’ said Brooksie,
‘what shall we do now?’ ‘Give the ball to
Ned,’ said I, ‘for an end run. I’ll look after
him.’ ‘Good stuff,’ said Brooksie. ‘I wish
you would.’ So Ned took the ball. ‘This way,
Ned,’ I called, and started off around the end.
‘Just a moment,’ said Ned. ‘I’ve turned my
ankle.’ ‘Well, I wouldn’t stop too long,’ I told
him, ‘for I think I see the enemy in the offing.’
So Ned rubbed his ankle a bit and then we
started off again. ‘Bear to the right, Ned,’ I
called, and Ned bore. About that time a few
of the Hall team sauntered madly up. The first
one I gave the straight-arm to and he turned
over twice—no, thrice. It <em>was</em> thrice, wasn’t
it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” laughed Ned. “How about
the apple crop, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Ned,” went on Spud, getting warmed up
to his narrative, “was now running strong at
my heels. The enemy surrounded us. One—two—three!
I pushed them aside. ‘Come
on!’ I shouted in a clarion voice. ‘Never say
die!’ So Ned came on. The enemy fell about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
us like ten-pins. We crossed the thirty yard-line,
the twenty-five. The goal was in sight.
But poor Ned’s strength was ebbing fast.
Finally he called to me faintly. ‘I can go no
further—farther!’ Did you say further or
farther, Ned? Anyway, defeat stared us in the
face. The hungry horde of Hall desperadoes
snapped at our heels. What to do? There was
not a minute to spare. Seizing Ned in my arms
I staggered on and fell fainting across the goal-line.
The day was won!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” laughed Ned, “that there
was anyone on that team but you and I, Spud.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t count,” said Spud. “Who
said apples?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got something lots nicer,” said Molly.
“Do you like cookies? I got cook to make a
whole panful yesterday. Shall I get them?”</p>

<p>“Shall you get them!” cried Hoop. “What
an absurd question.”</p>

<p>“Cookies for mine,” said Spud, smacking
his lips. “What kind of cookies are they,
Molly? Have they got sugar sprinkled on top
of them?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Cookies always have sugar on
them. I’ll get them. And there are plenty of
apples if you want them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think,” said Sandy, as Molly disappeared,
“that the—the <em>cuisine</em> at our club is very satisfactory,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled Spud, “the new French
chef is doing very well. I think the house committee
should be complimented. Oh, see who’s
here!”</p>

<p>Molly returned with a big yellow bowl filled
with golden brown cookies and passed them
around.</p>

<p>“I can smell the granilla,” said Spud.
“Granilla’s my favorite scent. Say, they’re
simply swell, Molly. You tell that cook that
she’s the best cookie cook I ever listened to.”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Spud,” commanded Sandy.
“You talk too much.”</p>

<p>“All right. You talk for a while. I’m going
to be too busy.”</p>

<p>The club continued in session until the last
cookie had vanished and the afternoon shadows
were slanting across the lawn outside. Then
West House, surfeited with cakes and apples,
said good-by to their hostess and went home
to supper!</p>

<p>Neither Cal nor Ned were very demonstrative
and so their reconciliation was a seemingly
matter-of-course event attended by no outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
manifestations of satisfaction. Boys of their
age haven’t much use for what they call
“gush,” and the nearest approach to this occurred
on Sunday night when, returning to their
room after the usual Sunday night concert in
the Tomb, Ned “squared off” at Cal, feinted
and then landed a vigorous punch on his chest
that sent him reeling backward on to his bed.</p>

<p>“You old chump,” said Ned affectionately.</p>

<p>But the next instant he evidently concluded
that even that might be construed as “gush”
and so thrust his hands into his pockets, turned
his back and whistled carelessly. Cal grinned
and picked himself up.</p>

<p>“Remember the night you woke me up, Ned,
and I thought you were a robber?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, you nearly killed me. Bet you knew
it was me all the time!”</p>

<p>There was no lack of conversation nowadays,
and instead of avoiding each other they seemed
hardly satisfied out of each other’s sight. West
House saw and marvelled.</p>

<p>“They’re like the Siamese Twins,” commented
Spud, “sort of stuck on each other,
what?”</p>

<p>But if they hadn’t much to say about their
quarrel or their renewal of friendship the mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
of the missing money was often discussed.
Monday night they went to work systematically
and ransacked the Den from end to end. But
they found nothing; or, at least, nothing they
were searching for. They did discover what
Ned called “a disgraceful state of affairs.” In
his lower bureau drawer, under a top covering
of underwear, lay about a half-bushel of apples
of which many were in the last stages of decay.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Ned, “I’d forgotten all about
them. Don’t they smell awful? I’ve thought
for a week or so that this place smelled a good
deal like a cider mill. Roll the waste basket
over here, Cal, and I’ll throw out the rotten
ones.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not do that, Ned. Marm’ll
see them and wonder.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. What’ll we do with them?”</p>

<p>Cal smiled wickedly. “Don’t ask me. They
aren’t my apples!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a disposition just like that,”
said Ned, holding up one far-gone apple. “I
guess I’ll leave these until tomorrow and then
lug them outside somewhere. Have one?”</p>

<p>“Not one like that,” answered Cal. “If
you’ve got a good one—”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are plenty of good ones left. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
wonder how long they’ve been here. I guess
it’s too warm for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why don’t you take them over and
let Spud keep them for you? They wouldn’t
be too warm in the Ice Chest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want them frozen,” laughed
Ned. He closed the drawer again and they
went on with their search. In the end they had
to acknowledge defeat, although as Ned pointed
out, their search had not been fruitless.</p>

<p>“I’ve got over five dollars myself,” said Cal.
“I cal’late I’d better hide it somewhere or it
may disappear too.”</p>

<p>“You can put it in my collar-box,” suggested
Ned with a grin.</p>

<p>But Cal declined. “That box is a hoodoo,”
he said. “There’s something wrong with it,
Ned. I don’t want my money collared too.”</p>

<p>Ned laughed, but Cal didn’t see the joke until
his unintentional pun had been explained to
him.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it in my trunk now,” he went on,
“but it isn’t locked because I’ve lost the key
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t worry,” said Ned. “Lightning
doesn’t strike twice in the same place, they
say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been only light practice that afternoon,
but on Tuesday Brooks held their noses
to the grindstone with a vengeance. He had
decided to discard two plays which had been
tried and found wanting and to substitute two
others which, he believed, were more likely to
succeed against Hall. Besides this, several of
the players were sent back to the dummy for
some needed eleventh-hour instruction in tackling,
and the effort to perfect team-play went
on unceasingly. The weather turned suddenly
cold Tuesday night and when Wednesday
dawned there was a heavy white frost on the
ground. After breakfast that morning Cal
found Sandy standing in the Tomb gazing at
the wall over the mantel.</p>

<p>“I was looking for a place to hang the Silver
Shield,” Sandy explained, “that is, if we get
it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” Cal asked, “that it will
come here to West House if we win it?” Sandy
nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, East House had it last time we won
and now it’s our turn. I guess I’d get Marm
to take down that picture there. I never did
like it, anyway. Maybe she’d let you have it
for your room, Cal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” Cal laughed. “That’s thoughtful
of you, Sandy. I’ll take it, though, if it’s to
make room for the shield.”</p>

<p>If Oak Park had been football-mad before, it
was hopelessly and violently afflicted with the
mania this final week. Excitement succeeded
excitement. Now rumor had it that Pete Grow
was very ill with tonsilitis or something and
wouldn’t be able to play. Now it was said that
Andy Westlake, the House Team center, was
in trouble over studies and had a week’s work
to make up. Another day Will M’Crae had
sprained his ankle, if reports were to be credited.
As it happened none of these direful
things had really taken place, but the news of
them served to add frenzy to the excitement.
The nearest approach to a catastrophe affecting
either team came when Barnes, a substitute
back for Hall, hurt his knee in practice on
Wednesday and said farewell to football for the
rest of the season. But Barnes was hardly
necessary to Hall’s success and so his accident
didn’t create the commotion it might have.
Even Molly became hysterical and talked football
whenever she could find someone to listen
to her. She spent several days making a House
flag. She could easily have bought one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
village but she preferred to fashion it herself.
It was of white silk with a red W. H. on it.
She worked madly, but on Thursday it looked
very much as though the flag would be still
unfinished when the game began on Saturday.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfectly lovely affair,” said Spud
when she exhibited it to him that noon, “but
<a href="#i_p349">why does the W look so rakish?</a>”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t, does it?” she asked anxiously,
holding the banner at arm’s length and observing
it critically. “Well, maybe it is a little
crooked. But the H is all right, Spud?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a dandy H. I wish, though, the
two hadn’t quarrelled, Molly. It seems so sad.
Aren’t you going to—what do you call it—hem
it around the edges?”</p>

<p>“Of course, but I wanted to see how the letters
were going to look first. I ought to have
a stick for it, oughtn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got one you can have. It’s got a flag
on it now but I can take that off. I say, if we
win Saturday I think you ought to give us that
for a trophy.”</p>

<p>“I will!” Molly clapped her hands delightedly.
“And you must put it over the Silver
Shield. Will you? Hoop says the shield will
hang in the parlor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350-<br />351]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. Now I have something to fight
for. What I’ve needed right along, Molly, was
an incentive. ’Tis there! Consider the game
won!”</p>

<p>Oddly enough it was Cal, practical, matter-of-fact
Cal, who had entertained a vast contempt
and hearty dislike of football a few weeks
before, who, of all the West House fellows, lost
his appetite toward the end of the week and
had what Spud called “the jumps.” Cal’s
short taste of battle had left him with a wild,
impatient desire to return to the ranks and
match his strength and skill with the enemy
once more. He pestered Ned for days asking
whether the latter thought he would get a
chance in the last game.</p>

<p>“I wish Brooks would put me in,” he said
wistfully. “I guess, though, he won’t while
Dutch or Griffin hold out. Gee, I’d like to get
in and do something fine, Ned; make a run such
as you made or kick a goal like M’Crae did!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get in for a while, anyway,” Ned assured
him on Thursday for the twentieth time.
“Griffin’s the fellow who’ll come out, though,
and not Dutch. You’d have to kill Dutch to
make him quit. Of course he might get sick,
I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“He—he’s looking pretty well, isn’t he?”
asked Cal.</p>

<p>“Fine,” laughed Ned. “So you needn’t
hope for that, Cal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t want him to be sick,” said
the other hurriedly. “Only—if he <em>was</em>—”</p>

<p>“Just so; you’d get his place. I’m going
to tell Dutch to watch out carefully. You may
try putting poison in his food.”</p>

<p>Cal laughed apologetically. Then, “I suppose
you couldn’t say anything to Brooks,
Ned?” he asked. “Just sort of mention my
name to him. You see, I sometimes think he
forgets about me!”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t. Don’t worry, you old
chump. You’ll get a show. But you mustn’t
expect to make a blooming hero of yourself,
’cause when you play in the line you don’t have
much chance at that sort of thing, Cal. You
just plug away and do your little best and then
after it’s over you read about how wonderful
the backs were. Perhaps you might read that
‘Boland at left tackle proved steady and effective,
and held his own with his opponent.’
The only way a line player ever breaks into the
hero class is when he blocks a kick, I guess.
And that’s more luck than science.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you block a kick?” asked Cal
thoughtfully. Ned grinned.</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard any receipt for it,” he
answered. “I guess it’s by playing your level
best and getting through on defense. Thinking
of trying it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I get a chance,” said Cal seriously.
“I cal’late I could get by that fellow Dixon,
Ned. Anyway, I’d try mighty hard!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A MYSTERY IS EXPLAINED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Thursday was the last day of real practice,
although on Friday there was a short
session of signal work, the fellows jogging
through the plays and Brooks explaining and
propounding. After supper that night West
House made its annual pilgrimage to East
House and was entertained with lemonade and
cake. It was a very merry and enjoyable evening.
Cal was privileged to sit for a while in
Frank Brooks’s room and hear football discussed
by masters of the game; Brooks,
M’Crae, the Westlake brothers, Ned and
Joe Boyle. Brooks proved that he hadn’t
forgotten Cal’s presence on the substitute
list.</p>

<p>“How are you, Boland?” he asked. “Feeling
ready for trouble tomorrow?”</p>

<p>Cal assured him that he was fine and wanted
terribly to insinuate some little hint to the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
that a place in the team on the morrow
wouldn’t be unacceptable.</p>

<p>When half-past nine came West House took
its departure, but not before it had cheered East
House and East House had returned the compliment
and both Houses had cheered loudly for
the Team. It had been a busy and exciting day
and sleep didn’t come readily to either Ned or
Cal that night. Even when Ned did finally drop
off to slumber he was the victim of disturbing
visions, and so, when, hours later, as it seemed,
he awoke with the vague impression that someone
was stirring in the room, he was unable at
first to determine whether he was really awake
or still asleep and dreaming.</p>

<p>But he finally convinced himself of consciousness.
The room was fairly light, for in the
November sky the remains of what had been
a full moon was sinking westward. There was
plenty of light to make easy recognition of the
white-clad figure. Ned blinked a moment and
then stared. Cal was lifting the lid of his trunk.
Ned wanted to ask him what he was doing, but
he was very sleepy. <a href="#i_p361">Cal</a> fumbled about the
trunk till a moment, then closed the lid again
and arose. Ned expected to see him get back
into bed, but he did nothing of the sort. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
he walked leisurely around the end of the two
beds, <a href="#i_p361">knelt in front of Ned’s bureau and opened
the bottom drawer</a>.</p>

<p>“Great Scott,” thought Ned, “he’s after an
apple! What a joke if he got a rotten one!”</p>

<p>He could hear Cal pushing the apples about
and grinned as he recalled the fact that, after
all, they had forgotten to sort the bad ones out.
Presently Cal stood upright again, turned and
retraced his steps toward the farther side of
his own bed. If he had found an apple to his
liking, at least he was not eating it. Ned lifted
himself on one elbow.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you find a good one?” he asked
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw you, Cal,” he said. “You’ll
have tummy-ache if you eat apples at this time
of night.”</p>

<p>Cal stepped silently into bed and pulled the
clothes up. It was then that Ned realized that
his roommate had been walking in his sleep!
How he knew it he couldn’t have told, for he
had never seen a performance of the kind before.
Perhaps it was the deliberation of Cal’s
movements about the room that gave him the
hint. At all events, he was positive that Cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
was a—a somnam—well, whatever it was! It
was a little bit uncanny at first and Ned felt a
creepy sensation along his spine. By that time
Cal’s breathing was long and regular and Ned’s
first impulse to awaken him passed. It would
be a shame to spoil a sleep like that; besides,
Ned had an idea that he had once read that to
awaken a—a somnambulist—that was it;
somnambulist!—was dangerous; dangerous to
the somnambulist, that is. No, he would let Cal
slumber on and tell him about it in the morning.
Besides, he was sort of sleepy himself! He
yawned, turned over and was soon back in
dreamland.</p>

<p>The morning dawned bright and crisp and
the breeze that stole in the open window tingled
the nostrils. Cal’s bare feet—as usual he was
the first out of bed—pattered hurriedly across
the floor and the window closed with a crash
that awoke Ned. Cal returned to his couch, sat
down on the edge of it, shivering, and tried to
remember what it was that he had dreamed during
the night. It was a very unpleasant dream;
something about burglars. That came of keeping
so much money on hand, he reflected; it
was enough to make any fellow uneasy and give
him bad dreams! Of course that money was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
all right, but he cal’lated he’d have a look. So
he thrust his feet into a pair of slippers and
went over to the trunk.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Ned, with a sigh, “what sort
of a day is it?”</p>

<p>“Bully,” answered Cal, lifting the lid of the
trunk. Ned looked across and recollection of
last night came to him. He chuckled.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a dandy joke on you, Cal,” he announced.
There was no reply for a moment.
Cal was pawing anxiously at the contents of
the till. At last, though,</p>

<p>“Is it—is it anything about my money?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No. What about your money?”</p>

<p>“It—it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” exclaimed Ned, sitting suddenly
upright. Cal nodded, frowning perplexedly
at the till.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it was here, Ned,” he said. “And
last night I dreamed of burglars again. It’s
gone where yours went, I cal’late.”</p>

<p>“But that’s—that’s piffle!” cried Ned.
“Burglars couldn’t come in here and—” He
paused, a light breaking upon him. Then he
threw his feet into the air and subsided backwards
on the bed, laughing at the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
lungs. Cal stood up and viewed him at first
with alarm and then with disgust.</p>

<p>“Mighty funny, ain’t it?” he demanded.
“There was ’most six dollars there!”</p>

<p>“Look—look in the apple drawer!” gurgled
Ned between paroxysms.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Look in—the apple—drawer, I—tell
you!”</p>

<p>Cal viewed his writhing friend bewilderedly
a moment, but then strode to Ned’s bureau and
pulled the drawer open. Ned stopped laughing
by a supreme effort, crawled to the foot of the
bed and looked over Cal’s shoulder. Cal stared
at the apples.</p>

<p>“What—what about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Look underneath,” advised Ned. “Pitch
the apples one side.”</p>

<p>Cal obeyed and then gave a cry.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Ned. Cal was holding a little
wad of bills in his hand.</p>

<p>“But—but—” he stammered.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It ain’t mine!”</p>

<p>“Not yours! Whose is it, then? Let’s see.
Gee, it’s mine, Cal!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned’s grin gave way to amazement, and then
for an instant suspicion returned.</p>

<p>“You put this in there last night, Cal,” he
said soberly.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> did! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What I say. You’re a somnambulist.”</p>

<p>Cal stared, doubtful.</p>

<p>“What—what did you say I was?” he demanded
ominously.</p>

<p>“A somnambulist; a sleep-walker; I saw
you last night! You went to your trunk and
rummaged around and then came over here,
opened that drawer, and I heard you fussing
with the apples. I thought you wanted one to
eat. Then you went back to bed and I spoke to
you and you didn’t answer. I spoke twice. Did
you know you were up? Do you remember it?”</p>

<p>“No.” Cal shook his head, his eyes wide
with surprise. “I never did that before, Ned,”
he said wonderingly. “Are you—sure? You
didn’t just dream it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! Besides, there’s the
money.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t have it,” said Cal, flushing.
“I—I told you so, Ned.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s so! Of course you didn’t.
But where—how—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_356">Cal knelt in front of Ned’s bureau and opened

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362-<br />363]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys stared at each other bewilderedly.
Then, with an exclamation, Ned
leaped from the bed and began fumbling
amongst the apples, and a moment later there
was a cry of triumph from both and Ned was
holding a second folded package of money in
his hand. From it a coin fell and rolled across
the floor.</p>

<p>“That’s mine!” cried Cal.</p>

<p>“Yep. Take it.” Ned got to his feet and
sat down on the edge of his bed, frowning
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” began Cal. But Ned interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“I do. It’s as plain as daylight now, Cal.
Listen. Do you remember when I told you that
I had eight dollars in my collar-box you said
you thought it wasn’t safe there?”</p>

<p>Cal nodded doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, the night we went for the apples you
dreamed of burglars; remember that? You
were the burglar, just as you were last night.
You had it on your mind that my money was
in the top drawer, so you got up in your sleep,
took it out of the collar-box and put it here
under the apples. You probably thought that
the burglars wouldn’t look there; and I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
they wouldn’t! It was you, don’t you see, that
Spud saw that night standing at the bureau!”</p>

<p>“But—but I never knew that I walked in
my sleep!” objected Cal. Ned shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Can’t help it, old man; you certainly do.
Then last night you had another one of your
burglar dreams and so you got up and saved
your own coin, and put it in the same place
with mine. I guess that explains that mystery,
Cal.”</p>

<p>Cal considered a moment. Then,</p>

<p>“I cal’late—I guess it does,” he agreed.
“But I never knew—”</p>

<p>“You said that before,” laughed Ned.
“Well, I’m glad to get it back, Cal, but I’m
a lot gladder to have it explained. Isn’t that
the funniest thing you ever heard of? And
won’t the fellows have a fit when they hear
about it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” muttered Cal. “Only—I
wish you wouldn’t say anything about it, Ned.
You see, I don’t really intend to walk around
like that in my sleep and do funny things.”</p>

<p>“You’d rather the others didn’t know? Oh,
all right. Only it does spoil a mighty good
story, Cal.” Ned looked at the bills in his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
“This is like finding money. What’ll we do
with it?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a new key for my trunk,”
answered Cal, “and lock mine up.”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to town and buy things.
Only I can’t today, I guess. You can’t play
good football on nut sundaes and college ices.
I suppose,” he added regretfully, “I’ll have to
wait until Monday. Then you and I, Cal, will
go down and have a regular feast!”</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” asked Cal, “how Molly
dreamed about me and apples that time? That
was sort of—sort of funny, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It surely was! I don’t suppose you’d like
me to tell even Molly, Cal?” Cal shook his
head.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p>“All right. But what shall I tell the fellows?
Just say I found it? That’ll do, I guess. None
of their business, anyway. Gee, what time is it
getting to be? We’ll have to get a move on,
chum!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>MOLLY WAVES A FLAG</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">If Ned wished to avoid explanations regarding
the recovery of his money he could have
had no better time to make his announcement
than at the breakfast-table that morning, for
everyone was far too interested in the event
of the afternoon to do more than express congratulations.
Brooks had instructed the players
to spend the morning in whatever way was
customary, but not to tire themselves. Molly
was on hand soon after breakfast. The silk flag
was finished to the last stitch and looked very
well even if, as Spud insisted, the W was
woozy.</p>

<p>“We shall be very proud to have that,
Molly,” said Sandy, “but there’s something
else I think we ought to have as a reward for
winning—if we do win.”</p>

<p>“Something else? What?” asked Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>“That pillow-case!”</p>

<p>“You shall! If House wins I’ll give it back.
Now, isn’t that generous of me, Sandy? For
after I give that up I’ll have no hold over any
of you any longer and you’ll all treat me just
shamefully.”</p>

<p>“You try us,” said Hoop.</p>

<p>“Besides, Molly,” remarked Spud, “’tis
better to rule by love than through fear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, listen to that!” jeered The Fungus.
“Sounds like the top line in a copy-book.
What’s the matter with ‘Honesty is the best
policy,’ Spud?”</p>

<p>“There’s a better one yet,” Spud reminded
him gravely. “‘Silence is golden,’ Fungus.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do this morning?”
asked Hoop moodily.</p>

<p>“Let’s go for chestnuts,” said Molly.
“Don’t you like them? I know where there
are lots and lots, bushels and bushels! And
we’ll have them boiled.”</p>

<p>“They’ll do for our club luncheon tomorrow,”
suggested Dutch. “Where are they,
Molly?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You come with me and I’ll
show you.”</p>

<p>“Not far, I hope,” said Spud. “I mustn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
get tired. I’ve got to run the length of the
field this afternoon for a touchdown.”</p>

<p>“Gee, you’d have to run about ten miles
before you’d ever make a touchdown,” said
The Fungus unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Spud. “The rest of
you can hunt chestnuts if you like; I’m going
to hunt toadstools!”</p>

<p>Whereupon he made for The Fungus. But
the latter was not caught so easily and they
had it around the house several times before
The Fungus was finally driven to bay. Spud
was valor itself as long as The Fungus fled
before him, but when the adversary put his
back to the house and invited closer acquaintance
Spud held off and viewed him dubiously.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he said finally, “you’re too hideous
to touch!”</p>

<p>They followed Molly to the woods and found
that she had not exaggerated so greatly after
all. The nuts were plentiful enough and the
frosts had started the burs opening. Of course
most everyone had trouble with the stickers
and Dutch actually sat down on a bur with
uncomfortable results. But they had a good
time and returned at half-past ten with nearly
two quarts of nuts. After that they sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
porch, in the sun for a while and ate as many
as they wanted. Then Molly took charge of
the rest and agreed to have them boiled for the
morrow’s meeting of the Pippin Club.</p>

<p>Dinner was early today, at twelve o’clock,
in order that the players might have time to
get over its effects before the game started at
two. But no one ate much, Cal especially being
extremely chary of food. He was much too
anxious and excited to eat. At one the fellows
left West House and went through the park
toward the gymnasium. They were all rather
silent, even Spud for once finding little to say.
Clara alone was absent as he had agreed to
wait and conduct Molly and Mrs. Linn to the
field.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned once on the way over,
“when we come back we’ll either be feeling a
lot better or a lot worse.”</p>

<p>And Sandy, who grew more pessimistic and
hopeless as the crucial hour drew nigh, answered:</p>

<p>“We’ll feel a heap worse, I guess!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The final game drew many friends of the
school to Oak Park that day and the seating
accommodations were quite inadequate. Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
before two o’clock the gridiron was edged with
spectators. On the Hall side, reposing on a
little table, lay the Silver Shield, the trophy
for the possession of which some forty-odd
boys had toiled and moiled day after day for
nearly two months. The sun shone brightly
and there was almost no breeze when the two
teams faced each other for the kick-off, but
there was a sharp wintery nip in the air that
made the watchers along the lines turn up coat-collars
and stamp about. The whistle piped
and the final game began.</p>

<p>I’m not going to tell you of that first half
in detail for more reasons than one. In the
first place nothing happened. In the second
place it was poorly played. Both teams, House
and Hall alike, were too eager. They missed
all sorts of opportunities, fumbled, played off-side,
held in the line and proceeded in the most
futile, headless manner imaginable. It seemed
as though House was politely doing its best
to hand the game to Hall, while Hall, determined
not to be outdone in courtesy, was resolved
to present the contest to its adversary.
All during that half Cal sat on the side of the
field, wrapped in a gray woollen blanket with
vivid red borders, and groaned in spirit as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
watched the teams tramp back and forth between
their respective thirty yard-lines. For
neither eleven had the remotest chance to
score. When the thirty minutes was up Cal
joined the others and trotted to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he was back in his
blanket, the teams had changed goals, the air
was colder and the shadows longer and it was
now or never. A ray of sunlight, dodging past
Doctor Webster’s shoulder, burned ruddily on
the Silver Shield. Perhaps it was meant as an
omen.</p>

<p>Cal wondered if Brooks would let him on.
He had been wondering that for days and days.
Now there was only a half-hour left and his
chance seemed wofully slim. Both Dutch and
Griffin were as strong as ever. Five minutes
passed. Hall had the ball on House’s forty-two
yards. Two plays with no gain, an attempted
forward pass and House had it. A
slow advance to Hall’s forty-eight yards and
again the pigskin changed hands. Hall kicked
on the second down and M’Crae ran the ball
back fifteen yards before he was thrown. An
end run by Ned gained four yards and Boyle
slammed through center for three more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
M’Crae kicked. Ten minutes had gone. Cal’s
heart grew leaden. Time was called and
Brooks turned toward the little group of substitutes.</p>

<p>“Hooper!” he called.</p>

<p>Hoop jumped up and threw aside his blanket.
Cal helped him peel off his sweater, envy
in full possession of him. Sandy, white and
weary, crept up and wrapped himself up.</p>

<p>“We’re playing simply rotten,” he groaned.
“We ought to have them licked by now.”</p>

<p>Fasset, of Hall, got away for a long run
around Spud’s end that took the ball to
House’s twenty-eight yards and Hall shouted
its joy. Two tries at the left wing netted but
six yards and Grow fell back as though for a
placement. McDonald knelt to place the ball
for him. But when the ball came he jumped up
and raced along the line, seeking an opening.
The trick failed, for the quarter was thrown
for no gain, and on the second play M’Crae
kicked out of danger. The half was fifteen
minutes old. Then came another pause and
Turner went in for A. Westlake at center and
the Hall made two changes. Cal, watching
Dutch and Griffin as a cat watches a mouse,
thought that the latter was at last showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
signs of wear. Back up the field toiled Hall,
trying desperate things now; runs around end
from trick formations, forward passes that seldom
worked, charges at the line from strange
angles. It was after one of these that Cal saw
Griffin being lifted to his feet. Cal’s heart
leaped into his throat and throbbed there uncomfortably
until Brooks turned and held up
his hand and called.</p>

<p>What was he saying? Cal strove to hear,
but his heart was making too much noise. It
was Sandy who prodded him.</p>

<p>“Go on in, you duffer! Brooks wants
you!”</p>

<p>A minute later Cal was looking into the pale,
perspiring face of Dixon. At last he was in!
The first few minutes passed as though in a
dream. Cal did mechanically what he had been
taught to do. Once someone thumped him
heavily on the back and a voice screeched:</p>

<p>“Lower, Boland! Get down there!”</p>

<p>Then it was House’s ball again. The signals
came, Cal leaped into his opponent and Ned
went twisting through with a rasping of canvas
and the panting of many breaths. Cal went
down with someone on his head. A hand
reached and yanked him to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“Second down!” called the referee.
“Seven to go.”</p>

<p>“Kick formation!” called M’Crae hoarsely.
“Twenty-two, twenty-six, fourteen—”</p>

<p>Dixon plunged at Cal and Cal threw himself
in his path. There was the sound of boot
against ball and he was racing down the field.
Ahead of him a Hall back was signalling a
fair catch. Then came a shout. The back had
missed the ball. Pandemonium broke loose on
the House side. Cal, racing up, found Spud
snuggling the ball to his arms, with half a
dozen players above him.</p>

<p>“House’s ball!” cried the referee. “First
down!”</p>

<p>“Line up, fellows! Get into this now!
Here’s where we score!”</p>

<p>That was Brooks, ecstatic. The ball was on
Hall’s thirty-two yards and there remained
eight minutes of time; plenty of time to win
or lose. Brooks went down the line, thumping
backs, encouraging, entreating.</p>

<p>“Play hard, House! Here’s where we win!
Play hard, <em>hard</em>, <span class="smcap">HARD</span>!”</p>

<p>“Watch for a forward pass!” shouted
Grow as the quarter knelt. Cal could hear
Brooks panting like a steam-engine beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Dixon, his opponent, shifted warily, his eyes
flitting from Cal to the ball. The signal came.
Cal wondered if he had got it right, but there
was no time for speculation. The lines clashed.
Dixon pulled him in and went through. But
the play was safe, Boyle, whirling like a Dervish
with the oval tightly clasped in his arms,
getting past tackle on the other end.</p>

<p>“Second down! Seven to go!”</p>

<p>“Signal!” piped M’Crae. “Signal! Sixty-two,
forty-one, thirteen, twenty-eight—”</p>

<p>Cal shot across at Pete Grow, Brooks in
advance, and Ned slammed by tackle for two
yards more. But there was still five to go and
the backs eyed M’Crae and their captain anxiously
as the teams lined up again. Brooks
had been playing for a touchdown, but now it
seemed that a try at a field-goal was all that
remained, for five yards was more than they
could hope to tear off at one try. But the ball,
although well inside the thirty yard-line, was
near the side of the field and the goal angle
was extreme.</p>

<p>“Kick formation!” called M’Crae, and
trotted back.</p>

<p>But when the signals came Cal knew that
there was to be no kick, and so did Pete Grow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Fake!</em>” he shouted. “<em>Fake!</em>”</p>

<p>But the warning was late, for a House player
stood almost on the side-line on the short side
of the field and after swinging his foot as
though kicking, M’Crae made a nice pass to
him. It was caught before the Hall left end
saw what was up. But the gain was short,
for the man with the ball was forced over the
line at the twenty-two yards. Still, it was first
down again and House still had the ball. In
came the pigskin fifteen paces and again the
teams faced each other. The Fungus squirmed
through for four yards, and Boyle slammed the
Hall center for three more.</p>

<p>“Third down!” called Brooks. “Only
three to go. Come on now, you House! Get
into this! Make it go!”</p>

<p>And make it go they did, although it was
necessary to bring the chain in and measure
the distance before Jim decided that House had
again won a first down. The Red was almost on
the ten yards now and the Blue was desperate.
Grow threatened and pleaded. Cal, the light
of battle in his eyes, gave Dixon all that youth
wanted to do. Once he and Brooks made such
an opening that Boyle, who carried the ball,
might have driven through in coach and four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
But the backs stopped him for a short gain.
Then The Fungus writhed past left tackle for
a good four yards and there was less than three
to go, and the ball was almost on the five yard
streak. Pandemonium reigned about the field.
Jim stopped the game while the crowd was
pushed back from the goal-line. Brooks
thumped an open hand with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do it, fellows, we’ve got to
do it!” he kept repeating. “They can’t stop
us now!”</p>

<p>It was two and a half to go for a first
down, five for a score. It was the height of
impudence to select Grow as the victim of the
next play, but he had been put effectively out
of it a moment before and M’Crae thought he
might again. There was a fake pass to Ned
and Boyle grabbed the ball and dashed past
Brooks. But Hall had sized up the play and
the secondary defense leaped forward to close
the gap. For an instant the line wavered. Cal,
fighting with every ounce of strength, felt it
give and a fierce exultation seized him. But
despair followed after, for the tide turned. He
felt himself going back. Beside him Boyle was
grunting and panting, the ball held tight. The
House backs threw themselves into the melee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
but it was no use. The whistle blew and the
referee pulled them away. They had lost first
down and the ball by a full yard on the very
threshold of victory! M’Crae, casting one despairing
look at Brooks, turned and trotted up
the field. Brooks, white and miserable, croaked
encouragement.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows, we’ll take it away from
them! How much time, please?”</p>

<p>The time-keeper trotted up, watch in hand.</p>

<p>“Four and a half minutes,” he called.</p>

<p>Hall, grinning and happy, settled into line.
The first plunge netted her six yards right
through House’s left wing. Brooks scolded
and stormed.</p>

<p>“Hold them! Hold them! Can’t you hold
them?”</p>

<p>Hall’s quarter started his signals, but Grow
stopped him. There was a whispered consultation
and Grow walked back behind his goal-line
and held his arms out.</p>

<p>“Kick!” shouted Brooks. “Block it, block
it, block it!”</p>

<p>Block it! Cal remembered Ned’s words.
Here, then, was his first and final chance to
show his worth! Could he get through? And
if he did could he get near the ball? He eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Dixon stealthily. That youth looked pretty
solid and formidable. To get inside of him
seemed hopeless. The only chance was to coax
him in and then get through between him and
end, and after that there was a long way to
go. But he would try it.</p>

<p>He edged close to Brooks and Dixon followed
him. Grow raised his arms. Center shot back
the ball. Cal feinted to the left and then sprang
past Dixon to the right. A back stood in his
way, but Cal sent him staggering. All was
confusion and cries and rushing players. Cal
saw Grow swing his long leg and heard, or
thought he heard the sound as boot met ball.
And then he was leaping sideways, arms up-stretched.
Something struck him fair under
the chin, something that staggered him and
then went bouncing erratically back past
Brooks, who was stumbling under the attack
of the enemy.</p>

<p>For what seemed a long minute to Cal he
couldn’t get started. When he did he dodged
a frantic pair of blue-clad arms and ran like
the wind. The ball was trickling along the turf
far back from the goal-line. Half a dozen players,
red and blue, were after it, but Cal was
ahead. A Hall player came tearing along behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
him and Cal knew that if he missed the
ball on the first attempt his chance was gone
forever. He didn’t wait until he was fully up
to it, but dived for it as a cat pounces at a
mouse. The distance was more than he had
thought and he came to earth with the teetering
pigskin an arm’s length away. But he got
it, reached it and grabbed it toward him just
as the pursuing foe fell upon him and drove
all the breath from his body. Others followed,
falling and scrambling. Someone tried to
wrest the prize away from him, but Cal, although
there was scarcely a gasp left in him
and his eyes seemed popping from his head,
hung to it tenaciously, striving hard to snuggle
it under his body. Then somewhere a
whistle blew and little by little the awful
weight lifted and he could draw a full breath
again.</p>

<p>“Let me have it, Boland.”</p>

<p>That was M’Crae’s voice and he was pulling
at the ball. But Cal only shook his head and
held on.</p>

<p>“It’s—mine!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Then someone turned him over on his back
and tore the ball from his hands and began
lifting his arms up and down. But Cal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
all right now. Brooks, grinning, his face as
white as a sheet of paper save for two disks
of red in the cheeks, pulled him to his feet and
hugged him.</p>

<p>“O you Boland!” he gasped huskily. “O
you Boland!”</p>

<p>Cal smiled embarrassedly.</p>

<p>“I cal’late that was a touchdown, wasn’t
it?” he asked.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was no goal kicked, but what did that
matter? House didn’t care and Hall could get
but slight satisfaction from the fact. Two
minutes later the game was over and House,
victor by 5 to 0, went cavorting and dancing
off the field, tired, aching, bruised and happy.</p>

<p>An hour later, after House had cheered itself
hoarse in front of the gymnasium, the West
House eight marched back across the park,
Sandy striding ahead with the Silver Shield
held proudly before him. The West House
eight did I say? Rather the West House nine,
for <a href="#i_frontis">beside Sandy tripped</a> Miss Molly Elizabeth
Curtis, <a href="#i_frontis">the Obnoxious Kid, waving triumphantly
her red and white banner</a>!</p>
